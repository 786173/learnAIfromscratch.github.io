<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org195f99b">
<p>
This is a (ongoing) workshop to learn foundational programming skills in designing, writing and optimizing software and is Part IA of the so-called <a href="https://learnaifromscratch.github.io">AI Tripos</a> to get to a level of competency to understand future courses in AI. Doing this concurrently with the other 2 parts helps to understand this material better as programming makes it easier to learn math and learning math makes it easier to program, though it's self contained. The way these notes work is I do this material with you, and point out anything that may trip up a beginner who then is likely to just give up. The further we go on, the more terse the notes will get because I can then assume a background. 
</p>

<p>
If you know how to use a web browser you can start this curriculum, no expertise in software installation, programming or any other background is assumed.

<p>
Don't post your solutions to the assignments anywhere, schools will hide them behind logins if too many solutions are posted. Some of the AI courses we'll see later the assignments have been restricted to the public. We'll work around this but it's annoying.

<p>
Have the attitude you refuse to not know the material and you'll be fine. If you find you have no time to do this, try getting up a little early so you can put in a single hour that day before doing whatever it is you have to do. Repeat this and by the end of the year you will have put in hundreds of hours you never thought you had.

We begin with Brown University's CS019 <i>Accelerated Introduction to Computer Science</i> which is 2 semesters combined into one and as a result omits some tedious analytical details you would find in regular classes that you can always research on your own should you later require those things. Look around the various course <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs019/">pages</a>, like the <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0190/2019/README.html">readme</a>, and the notes about the <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0190/2019/policy.html#(part._.Unusual_.Assignments)">unusual assignments</a> which respects the intelligence of the student. Look around the instructor's <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/">page</a> like his manifesto on the current state of compsci education, and scroll through his <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/">papers</a>. Skim through the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/rkf-student-ta-hours/paper.pdf">paper</a> on 'What Help Do Students Seek in TA Hours?' because it's from the exact course we are about to take. 'TA' is a teaching assistant, usually a student who did well in the course before. This is a quora <a href="https://www.mooclab.club/threads/what-does-professor-shriram-krishnamurthi-expect-a-student-to-know-after-he-she-works.4012/">post</a> about the book we'll do with the course from the writer/instructor "A person completing the first half is ready for most upper-level computer science". We're doing the entire book. 
</p>

<p>
There is a <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0190/2019/placement.html">placement</a> for the course but we're going to skip it, CS019 assumes no background the placement tests are to see if you can keep up with their very difficult first few months of nonstop assignments. We're not under a deadline.

<h2 id="org5606674">Lecture 1</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5606674">
<p>
We're starting with the lecture titled <a href="https://brown.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=f53a52c3-2d36-406a-bde4-a952013df5e2">Wed 9/5/18</a>. Go to code.pyret.org and click <i>open editor</i> as you follow along the lecture. The book will cover everything he's doing like what a list is, what a function is, this is just a demonstration of the online interpreter. You can run Pyret <a href="https://www.pyret.org/set-sail/">offline</a> too. 
</p>

<p>
Notice he shuts down a lot of out of scope questions to not derail the lecture.  
</p>

<p>
@34:20 is the private app Exemplar which we don't have access to, and is usually an extra assignment on homework. The idea is that the students are given a task 'write a program that calculates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median">median</a> of data in a list'. They start by writing the tests first before implementing the program, to get you to think about the problem. The exemplar app already has a working (and purposely buggy) implementation of the assignment that they can't see the source code for which is where the 'chaffs' are found (potential bugs caught). We will just have to write a lot of tests ourselves, covering enough cases until we've fleshed out the problem enough that we can go about implementing it. 
</p>

<p>
So how can we figure out the student given test cases for the median program? By looking up what a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median">median</a> is and the procedure to find it. Reading that article we see that the median is a value that seperates a finite list of numbers, that can be found by arranging them from the smallest to the greatest. If there is an odd number of entries, the middle number that splits the list into two even parts is picked. Otherwise it is defined to be the mean of the two middle values which means add them both and divide by 2, the idea being getting as close as possible to evenly splitting the data. That's why the test for [list: 1, 3, 2] is 2 because your program would reorder the list to be [list: 1, 2, 3] and choose 2 as the median. The Fermi problems he talks about must be released on Piazza which requires campus logins, <a href="https://piazza.com/class">https://piazza.com/class</a> is a kind of wiki/msg forum for courses that encourages anonymous postings so students don't feel embarassed to ask questions. A lot of universities now solely distribute their course materials through it meaning the public doesn't have access anymore. You can find these yourself online anyway by searching for Fermi problems. 
</p>

<p>
At the end he mentions the design recipe, as a way to save TAs time, explaining if you show up to office hours for help they will go about writing a template with the student, going through all the various stages and not just giving them an answer. He notes it is totally optional to use the design recipe, but it will help you with the hard assignments and if you're going to office hours with a lot of questions clearly your methods aren't working so why not try their method. If you read that <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/rkf-student-ta-hours/">paper</a> <i>What Help Do Students Seek in TA Office Hours</i> in the beginning of this workshop you'll see statistical results of the outcomes of students who used the design recipe vs those that didn't and their final grades. 
</p>

<p>
Templates are covered in the third lecture, it's just a tool to extract 'code for free' from your data and will be useful for some of the assignments.

<p>
Let's work through the <a href="https://papl.cs.brown.edu/2019/index.html">book</a> starting at the beginning, I'm using whatever the latest version is (as of this writing, 2019). This book is a work in progress so you'll see some minor errors like "REF" which is supposed to later be a link to whatever reference in the text that's not finished yet.
</p>

<p>
Chapter 2 <i>Basic Data and Expressions</i> do while you have the pyret interpreter at code.pyret.org open. The examples with "&gt;" in front of them indicates enter this into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a>, on the right hand side of the pyret code editor like he did in the lecture pressing enter to eval. It's running a read-eval-print-loop (repl) which means exactly what you think it means. It reads input, evaluates it, prints it to the console and then loops back to waiting to read input again. You can increase the font size if you click the lambda skull logo on the top left side. 
</p>

<p>
Already we are introduced to built-in functions, such as num-expt. To understand these, let's read the <a href="https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/Builtins_and_Libraries.html">documentation</a> something we will have to a lot of to complete the assignments, and is good training since for all future courses we'll need to look at their documentation. If you have a small screen, you will need to turn your device to landscape or increase the browser window size in order to see the table of contents in the pyret docs which automatically hide depending on screen size and is annoying UI. Find the number functions <a href="https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/numbers.html#(part._.Number_.Functions)">documentation</a> by hitting Ctrl-F in your browser or otherwise searching the page for 'num-expt'. Here is how you <a href="https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/numbers.html#(part._numbers_num-expt)">read</a> it. The "::" syntax refers to type expected, so num-expt(base :: Number, exponent :: Number) -&gt; Number is annotation telling you this built-in requires two inputs: a base and an exponent of type number, and it outputs a number. This will be explained in chapter 3. Repeat looking in the documentation to understand what string-subtring() does. Try changing the examples yourself in the REPL as you go. 
</p>

<p>
The last section on roughnums, where irrational numbers like the square root of two return different values is due to floating point approximation. It uses a 'round to nearest' rounding strategy which if you wanted you could learn from this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVg_tUyyQzA&amp;list=PL3swII2vlVoVspHvAYIvnbbqdV8oEuxkw&amp;index=5&amp;t=0s">lecture</a> but it assumes a technical background we don't have yet, namely that you've completed all the other lectures in that playlist and an introductory programming course, which we are doing right now. The final exercise <i>Do roughnums obey the axioms of arithmetic operators like distributivity, associativity and commutativity?</i> you can tell immediately from the examples in the book that roughnums are always returning different values, so a + b does not equal b + a if the numbers are roughnums. Think to yourself what would happen if you used floating point to encode money in financial software, with unpredictable results if some trade combination resulted in a roughnum. Oops

You spent all of chapter 2 entering commands into the REPL on the right hand side of the pyret online editor, now you'll use the left hand side to write functions and run them by either pressing Ctrl-Enter or the <i>Run</i> button. In 3.5 <i>Defining Functions in Steps</i> notice he changes the tests to not just return the expected value, but to return the expected computation, writing out in full what should be happening. The idea of doing this is to help you write the function. These aren't tests to prove it is correct, they are tests to help understand the full domain of the problem so we can write a model for it with software. 
</p>

<p>
I'm assuming you're doing all the exercises. Let's walk through the 'has-overtime' raises exercise.
</p>

<pre class="example">
fun has-overtime(hours :: Number) -&gt; Boolean:
  doc: "Returns true if hours &gt; 40 or returns false. Hours must be a positive number or error is raised"
  if hours &lt; 0:
    raise("hours must be greater than zero")
  else if hours &gt; 40:
      true
  else:
    false
  end
where:
  has-overtime(40) is false
  has-overtime(40.0001) is true
  has-overtime(-1) raises "hours must be greater than zero"
end
</pre>

<p>
Notice raise() is a built-in function. Where did I find this? In the pyret language documentation. 
</p>

<p>
Let's write some tests for the last exercise hours-to-wages-ot as an example of how writing tests essentially writes the program for you. We have to write a function that consumes hours, an hourly rate, a threshold for OT, and returns anything over that threshold at 1.5 times the rate, adding it to the total pay. 
</p>

<p>
First, let's write the parameters:
</p>
<pre class="example">
fun hours-to-wage-ot(hours :: Number, rate :: Number, threshold :: Number) -&gt; Number:
  doc: "Calculates total pay with all hours over threshold at 1.5 the rate"
where:
end
</pre>
<p>
now let's write the tests:
</p>
<pre class="example">
where:
 hours-to-wage-ot(10, 1, 40) is 10 * 1
 hours-to-wage-ot(41, 1, 40) is (40 * 1) + (1 * (1 * 1.5))
 hours-to-wage-ot(50, 20, 48) is (48 * 20) + ((50 - 48) * (20 * 1.5))
end
</pre>

<p>
Keep writing test cases where you don't just write the final expected result, but how you would arrive at that result. Now writing this program is easy, all I did here was copy the last test case, and the first test case to the function body:
</p>
<pre class="example">
fun hours-to-wages-ot(hours :: Number, rate :: Number, threshold :: Number) -&gt; Number:
  doc: "Calculates pay with all hours over threshold at 1.5 the rate"
  if hours &gt; threshold:
    (threshold * rate) + ((hours - threshold) * (rate * 1.5))
  else:
    hours * rate
  end
where:
  hours-to-wages-ot(10, 1, 40) is 10 * 1
  hours-to-wages-ot(41, 1, 40) is (40 * 1) + (1 * (1 * 1.5))
  hours-to-wages-ot(50, 20, 48) is (48 * 20) + ((50 - 48) * (20 * 1.5))
end
</pre>

Watch the Mon9/10/18 second lecture. Interesting lecture about 'the rainfall problem' and the benefits of writing a lot of examples in order to understand badly defined problems. Data science/machine learning is brought up, as examples of dirty data. Higher-order functions were talked about, like filter and map which are in the pyret documentation. We're going to write our own versions of map, filter and fold after we cover Chapter 6 <i>Processing Lists</i>.

This is an interesting and short chapter how you would go about converting data to rows. There's nothing in here you can't already figure out now that you know how to read the documentation for pyret. The goal here is not to memorize all the built-in functions of Pyret but just gain extra experience changing the examples, and learning how to take data and make it into a program. I noted the text also expects you to start reading documentation, not telling you how to assign a table to a variable so you can run all those sieve expressions on it. See the docs and change the examples in the text as you go to see what they do:
</p>

<pre class="example">
my-table = table: name, age
  row: "Alice", 30
  row: "Bob", 40
  row: "Carol", 25
end

sieve my-table using name:
  name == 'Carol'
end

order my-table:
  name ascending
end
</pre>

<p>
This is similar to <a href="https://n0x400.1mb.dev/#org268f85c">SQL syntax</a>, where you just declare what you want to do to rows and columns instead of how to do it. 4.2.6 selecting syntax is exactly like SQL syntax. Congrats you know some SQL now. Note in 4.2.7 the <i>principle of orthogonality</i> comment on why they composed these table row operations to be independent of each other so combining them in complex expressions is possible.

<p>
<i>Do Now</i> from 4.2.3. We are asked to think about how to write two questions, the first one is given to us so I tried the second which asks <i>Of the songs by a particular artist, which have we played the least often?</i>" using only what we've seen so far: 
</p>

<pre class="example">
my-playlist = 
  table: artist, song, playcount
    row: "Lustre", "The First Snow", 10
    row: "Lustre", "Green Worlds", 1
    row: "Lustre", "Welcome Winter", 2
  end

order my-playlist:
  playcount ascending
end
</pre>

<p>
Second Exercise <i>Write the second example as a composition of keep and order operations on a playlist table</i>.
</p>

<pre class="example">
my-playlist = 
  table: artist, song, playcount
    row: "Lustre", "The First Snow", 10
    row: "Lustre", "Green Worlds", 1
    row: "Lustre", "Welcome Winter", 2
  end

composition = order my-playlist:
  playcount ascending
end

sieve composition using playcount:
  playcount &lt;= 1
end
</pre>

<p>
Read ahead and play around with this, maybe you just want to return the song name, not the artist name and playcount, experiment with the documentation on your own:
</p>

<pre class="example">
my-playlist = 
  table: artist, song, playcount
    row: "Lustre", "The First Snow", 10
    row: "Lustre", "Green Worlds", 1
    row: "Lustre", "Welcome Winter", 2
  end

least-played = order my-playlist:
  playcount ascending
end

select song, playcount from least-played end

In 5.3.1 the description of the properties of an 'anonymous value' abstraction by using numbers and asking what they mean is similar to Terence Tao's <i>Linear Algebra</i> text where he points out that a property of numbers that makes them useful is their ability to be interpreted differently depending on context. 
</p>

<p>
A <i>Do Now</i> appears. This means we should actually do it. Try to sieve our playlist to show the most played song using built-in language functions from the math/statistics library: 
</p>

<pre class="example">
include math
include statistics

my-playlist = 
  table: artist, song, playcount
    row: "Lustre", "The First Snow", 10
    row: "Lustre", "Green Worlds", 1
    row: "Lustre", "Welcome Winter", 2
  end

play-count = extract playcount from my-playlist end
most-played-count = max(play-count)

sieve my-playlist using playcount:
  playcount == most-played-count
end
</pre>

<p>
Lists are introduced, which is the datastructure we will be using for a lot of the exercises. 
</p>

<p>
Important: the Exercise in 5.4.2 <i>Implement all the other statistical questions posed in Basic Statistical Questions</i> is mandatory. They look easy after reading the book examples, and you definitely will think to yourself 'oh I already know this, time to move on' but you only learn by doing. Remember experts in learning have constructed this book and course and know exactly what you need to do in order to be successful in completing it. There will always be one or two questions in there that will stump you a little and require research to solve the exercise and when you figure it out you will never forget how you found that solution whereas if you skip this exercise, you'll promptly forget in a few days time. So let's look at them:
</p>

<p>
'keep-if' isn't a real built-in, it's pseudo-code. Let's go through 5.1 <i>Basic Statistical Questions</i> but using our my-playlist as an example. These will all be functions on lists, because we use extract built-in function to remove this information from a table and extract returns a list.
</p>

<pre class="example">
# notice these import statements so we can use these built-in function
include math
include statistics
import lists as L

my-playlist = 
  table: artist, song, playcount
    row: "Lustre", "The First Snow", 10
    row: "Lustre", "Green Worlds", 1
    row: "Lustre", "Welcome Winter", 2
  end

# From 5.1 Basic Stat Questions:
# Question 1, 2, and 3 are the same: the maximum or largest value
# To see what these datastructures look like, type 'play-count' into REPL
play-count = extract playcount from my-playlist end
most-played-count = max(play-count)

sieve my-playlist using playcount:
  playcount == most-played-count
end

# Smallest value in a column 
least-played-count = min(play-count)

# Number of songs in a playlist
# Since we have extracted a list, we just need to count the length of the list using a built-in function
# using: play-count = extract playcount from my-playlist end
play-count.length()

# All the distinct entries in playcount column
# Another built-in from lists documentation
# Notice import lists as L, you can call this something else 'import lists as whatever' 
L.distinct(play-count)

# The number of distinct entries in a playcount column
# Asking us: count how many entries are distinct
# Note we are chaining built-ins together here:
L.distinct(play-count).length()

# The average, this is another built-in, from this exact chapter
avg-play-count = mean(play-count)

# Other statistics
# Just replace x(play-count) with that built-in from the statistics library 
modes-play-count = modes(play-count)
median-play-count = median(play-count)
stdev-play-count = stdev(play-count)
</pre>

<p>
That was a little tedious but it taught us how to look up documentation, how to use import or include statements.

<p>
We need to understand this chapter to follow along with the rest of the lectures, and for future assignments. 6.1 you can type all those examples in the REPL to see what they do, like manually linking a list together with link. 
</p>



<p>
6.2 Let's make some list functions:
</p>

<pre class="example">

# Examples first. List&lt;Any&gt; means will accept any type (string, number)
# Length only counts the number of items, not nested list items:
fun my-len(l :: List&lt;Any&gt;) -&gt; Number:
  doc:"Returns the length of a list"
  check:
    my-len([list: ]) is 0
    my-len([list: 1, 2, 3]) is 3
    my-len([list: 1, [list: 1, 2], 99]) is 3
    my-len([list: [list: empty], 1]) is 2
  end
end

# From these examples we can build the function:
fun my-len(l :: List&lt;Any&gt;) -&gt; Number:
  doc:"Returns the length of a list"
  cases (List) l:
    | empty =&gt; 0
    | link(f, r) =&gt; 1 + my-len(r)
  end
end
check:
  my-len([list: ]) is 0
  my-len([list: 1, 2, 3]) is 3
  my-len([list: 1, [list: 1, 2], 99]) is 3
  my-len([list: [list: empty], 1]) is 2
end
</pre>

<p>
This is how my-len() is evaluated if you call my-len() with list 1, 2, 3:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>my-len([list: 1,2,3])</li>
<li>1 + my-len([list: 2, 3])</li>
<li>1 + (1 + my-len([list: 3]))</li>
<li>1 + (1 + (1 + my-len([list: empty])))</li>
<li>1 + 1 + 1 + 0 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>= 3</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<p>
Let's do another 6.2 list exercise:
</p>
<pre class="example">
# Compute the sum of a list (of numbers)
# Start with examples, and run your examples just to make sure they are well formed/syntax
fun my-sum(l :: List&lt;Number&gt;) -&gt; Number:
  doc: "Returns the sum of numbers in a list"
  check:
    my-sum([list: ]) is 0
    my-sum([list: 1, 2, 3]) is 6
    my-sum([list: -1, -2]) is -3
    my-sum([list: [list: ], [list: 2, 3], 3]) is 8
    my-sum([list: 2]) is 2
  end
end

# Let's try and write this
fun my-sum(l :: List&lt;Number&gt;) -&gt; Number:
  doc: "Returns the sum of numbers in a list"
  cases (List) l:
    | empty =&gt; 0
    | link(f, r) =&gt; f + my-sum(r)
  end
end
  check:
    my-sum([list: ]) is 0
    my-sum([list: 1, 2, 3]) is 6
    my-sum([list: -1, -2]) is -3
    my-sum([list: [list: ], [list: 2, 3], 3]) is 8
    my-sum([list: 2]) is 2
  end

</pre>

<p>
One test failed! It didn't count the nested list. We weren't expected to write functions that can handle deeply nested lists or anything, but for learning purposes let's see if we can anyway. What does the built-in sum return:
</p>

<pre class="example">
import math
sum([list: 3, 3, [list: 2, 3]])
</pre>

<p>
It fails too, so let's clean the data first 
</p>

<pre class="example">
import lists as L

fun my-sum(l :: List&lt;Number&gt;) -&gt; Number:
  doc: "Returns the sum of numbers in a list"
  cases (List) l:
    | empty =&gt; 0
    | link(f, r) =&gt; f + my-sum(r)
  end
end
check:
  my-sum([list: ]) is 0
  my-sum([list: 1, 2, 3]) is 6
  my-sum([list: -1, -2]) is -3
  my-sum(clean-data([list: ], [list: [list: ], [list: 2, 3], 3])) is 8
  my-sum([list: 2]) is 2
end

# .filter() function no-empty is below
# is-link is built-in, see documentation
fun clean-data(l1 :: List&lt;Any&gt;, l2 :: List&lt;Any&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;Any&gt;:
  doc: "Removes nested lists, call with clean-data(empty-list, list-to-clean)"
  cases (List) l2:
    | empty =&gt; l1.filter(no-empty)
    | link(f, r) =&gt;
      if is-link(f):
        temp = L.append(l1, f)
        clean-data(temp, r)           
      else:
        temp = l1.push(f)
        clean-data(temp, r)
      end
  end
end

# .filter(function) if boolean == true then only those items will be returned
fun no-empty(l3 :: List&lt;Any&gt;) -&gt; Boolean:
 doc: "Predicate for empty case clean-data() filter"

# try to implement yourself, could even do if is-empty(l3): false else: true 
end
</pre>
<p>
How clean-data() evals is test if f == a list structure, if it does we append the entire embedded list to an accumulator, and then loop again with the accumulator now becoming parameter 'l1' input. On the empty case you return the accumulator, which here is l1 filtered to remove any [list: empty] using the .filter() built-in you can read about in the documentation. We're going to do a lab soon where we implement functions like map/filter/fold from scratch to really understand what they do. Try implementing the rest of the functions in 6.2 as the more practice you have doing this the easier the lectures and assignments will be. Note this is not an efficient solution, just it's the easiest demonstration. 
</p>

<p>
If this doesn't make sense step by hand through clean-data():
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>clean-data(l1, list-to-clean)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>l1 is empty when first called</li>
</ul></li>
<li>is f == to a list datastructure? if so append the whole embedded list to temp-list and loop again</li>
<li>clean-data(temp-list, rest-of-list-to-clean)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>temp-list is now l1</li>
</ul></li>
<li>if f is not an embedded list, then push the value of f to l1 and assign it to temp-list again</li>
<li>clean-data(temp-list, rest-of-list-to-clean)</li>
<li>if we reach end of the list-to-clean, filter for any empties and return l1, the fully cleaned list</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="org2890376">Assignment 1: DocDiff</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2890376">
<p>
Let's try the first <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs019/2018/docdiffdocdiff.html">assignment</a>. One way to slog through a long chapter on list functions is to actually implement something using lists, then we can refer to it as reference. In other words it becomes a research project to read that we are more motivated to do since we're trying to complete a task.
</p>

<p>
This assignment looks difficult on purpose but is easy to implement. You're just translating instructions. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product#Algebraic_definition">dot product</a> algebraic definition, look at the example for [1,3,-5] x [4,-2,-1]. Each index in the first list is multiplied by it's corresponding index in the second list, then those results are added together. To read the sigma notation, a*b = the sum of \(a_ib_i\) starting at index 1 (first element of the list) up to the length of the list (n):
</p>

<details>
<p>
If a = [1, 3, -5] and b = [4, -2, -1]:
</p>

<p>
\(a*b = \sum_{i=1}^3 a_ib_i\) = (\(1_{a1} * 4_{b1})+(3_{a2} * -2_{b2})+(-5_{a3} * -1_{b3})\)
</p>
</details>

<p>
Some more requirements are listed, such as ignoring the case (upper/lower) of a letter when counting it's number of occurences. The exact equation for overlap is given, you can google 'what is the square of a vector' to find it's the dot-product of itself. 
</p>

<p>
Example vectors:
</p>

<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left">

<td class="org-right">1</td>

</tbody>
</table>


<pre class="example">
fun overlap(doc1 :: List&lt;String&gt;, doc2 :: List&lt;String&gt;) -&gt; Number:

check:
  overlap([list: "cat"], [list: "dog"]) is 0
  overlap([list: "same"], [list: "same"]) is 1 
  overlap([list: "test"], [list: "zest"]) is-roughly dot-product([list: 1, 0], [list: 0, 1]) / 
  num-max(num-sqrt(dot-product([list: 1, 0], [list: 1, 0])), 
    num-sqrt(dot-product([list: 0, 1], [list: 0, 1])))
  end
end
# there should also be a capitalization test here for "Same" and "same" is 1
</pre>

<p>
The assignment constraints are we can use any built-in library we wish except sets. Look through some of them in the pyret docs, import them and you can chain them together for example to create a total unique word list from the combination of both lists (you can also do this assignment without any of these built-ins just writing cases (List) functions):
</p>

<pre class="example">
import lists as L
include math

# create total word space 
# doesn't covert everything to same case
allWords = L.sort(L.distinct(list1 + list2))

# Try the .filter() and .map() built-ins, see pyret documentation
fun dot-product(vec1 :: List&lt;Number&gt;, vec2 :: List&lt;Number&gt;) -&gt; Number:
  sum(map2(_ * _, vec1, vec2))
where:
  dot-product([list: 2], [list: 1]) is 2
  dot-product([list: 1, 2], [list:  2, 1]) is 4
end

# counts the number of same words in a document (list)
# syntax (_ == word).length() is from the documentation 2.1.11.5 Curried Application Expressions
# filter will go through each element of a list and return a new list containing all boolean=true elements
# .length() returns the size of the new filtered list, representing the count of all same entries 

fun countlist(lst :: List&lt;String&gt;, word :: String): -&gt; Number:
  lst.filter(_ == word).length()
where:
  countlist([list: "e","e"], "e") is 2
end
</pre>

<p>
A create-vector() function can consume two lists of words, a document and allWords, and do cases on allWords, if f is a member of doc1, call your countlist function to count and return the total count of similar words, link that returned amount or link 0 and recurse through the rest of allWords. All of this is written in the rest of Chapter 6 that is now a research project to help complete the assignment, so you don't have to blindly go through it without motivation. 
</p>

<p>
My implementation is hacky and missing many test cases, and missing proper documentation, because we haven't done analysis yet (fourth lecture) so we can get away with beginner hacky code for now. I also didn't follow the Pyret <a href="https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/Pyret_Style_Guide.html">style guide</a>.

We're watching Wed9/12/18 lecture on sorting. These videos you can download in 1920x1080 if you want and zoom if you can't see the writing on the whiteboard. 
</p>

<p>
He walks through exactly what a template is and how to extract data to make a template, and spends the rest of the class writing insertion sort using only what we already know so far. You have to hand step through it a little to understand what insertion sort is doing. 
</p>

<p>
Function sort() is calling insert() with insert(f, sort(r)). Read that carefully, it isn't calling insert(f, r) to just hand it the rest of the list, it's calling insert with sort(r). 
</p>

<p>
Let's step the evaluation by hand with [list: 0, 1, 3, 2] being input to sort(). The following calls to insert happen:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>insert 0(insert 1,(insert 3(insert 2, [list: empty])))</li>
</ul>

<p>
It's like our example with my-len() with 1 + 1 + etc. Evaluation starts at the deepest inner bracket:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>insert(2, [list: empty])
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>is 2 &lt; empty?</li>
<li>link(2, link(empty))</li>
<li>return to sort(): [list: 2, empty]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>insert(3, [list: 2, empty])
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>is 3 &lt; 2?</li>
<li>link(2, insert(3, [list: empty]))</li>
<li>return to sort(): [list: 2, 3, empty]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>insert(1, [list: 2, 3, empty])
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>is 1 &lt; 2? 
link(1, link(2, link(3, link(empty))))</li>
<li>return to sort(): [list: 1, 2, 3, empty]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>insert(0 [list: 1, 2, 3, empty])
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>is 0 &lt; 1?</li>
<li>link(0, [list: 1, 2, 3, empty])</li>
<li>return to sort(): [list: 0, 1, 2, 3, empty]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>no more delayed computations, sort() is finished</li>
</ul>

We'll do this after CS019, as we need to learn how to build things like parsers when there is no good existing library in python/julia/whatever to do so. We'll do the <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/Videos/">lectures</a> and 2012 book, and the newer <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2017/assignments.html">mystery languages</a> assignments.
He may even put up a new PLAI by the time we get to it, he'll start writing up the 2020 version in the <a href="https://www.plai.org/">spring</a>.
