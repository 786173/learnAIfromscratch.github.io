<h2 id="org5b38afc">Intro</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5b38afc">
<p>
This is a (ongoing) workshop to learn foundational programming skills in designing, writing and optimizing software and is Part IA of the so-called <a href="https://learnaifromscratch.github.io">AI Tripos</a>. The way these notes work is I do this material with you, and point out anything that may trip up a beginner who then is likely to just give up. The further we go on, the more terse the notes will get because I can then assume a background. The courses and books we will do promote that you try and figure out things for yourself as the only proven way to learn this material but their targeted audience is elite students who qualify to get into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League">Ivy League</a> so we'll have to backtrack as we go filling in some holes in our education in the early lectures. 
</p>

<p>
If you know how to use a web browser you can start this curriculum, no expertise in software installation, programming or any other background is assumed. This means if you only own a phone or tablet, you can still complete this material.

<h3 id="orgf8abb52">Code of Conduct</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf8abb52">
<p>
Don't post your solutions to the assignments anywhere, such as keeping a public github with every assignment completed. Schools will hide them behind logins if too many solutions are posted. Some of the AI courses we'll see later the assignments have been restricted to the public. We'll work around this but it's annoying.

<h3 id="org895c831">Study advice</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org895c831">
<p>
Have the attitude you refuse to not know the material and you'll be fine. Try giving a lecture to an imaginary class from notes you took to prove you actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok#Adoption_and_modern_usage">grok</a> this material. If you can effortlessly explain the topic without stumbling over your words, using excessive jargon or forgetting your notes you can be assured you know the material. To get around the habit of jargon, imagine everytime you use jargon that somebody asks you to define precisely what it means and you have to stop your imaginary lecture and unravel technical language.

<p>
We begin with Brown University's CS019 <i>Accelerated Introduction to Computer Science</i> which is 2 semesters combined into one and as a result omits some tedious analytical details you would find in regular classes that you can always research on your own should you later require those things. Look around the various course <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs019/">pages</a>, like the <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0190/2019/README.html">readme</a>, and the notes about the <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0190/2019/policy.html#(part._.Unusual_.Assignments)">unusual assignments</a> which respects the intelligence of the student. Look around the instructor's <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/">page</a> like his manifesto on the current state of compsci education, and scroll through his <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/">papers</a>. Skim through the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/rkf-student-ta-hours/paper.pdf">paper</a> on 'What Help Do Students Seek in TA Hours?' because it's from the exact course we are about to take. 'TA' is a teaching assistant, usually a student who did well in the course before. This is a quora <a href="https://www.mooclab.club/threads/what-does-professor-shriram-krishnamurthi-expect-a-student-to-know-after-he-she-works.4012/">post</a> about the book we'll do with the course from the writer/instructor "A person completing the first half is ready for most upper-level computer science". We're doing the entire book. 
</p>

<p>
There is a <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0190/2019/placement.html">placement</a> for the course but we're going to skip it, CS019 assumes no background and we have the luxury of time to fill in any blanks.

<h2 id="org0d0da85">Lecture 1</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0d0da85">
<p>
We're starting with the lecture titled <a href="https://brown.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=f53a52c3-2d36-406a-bde4-a952013df5e2">Wed 9/5/18</a>. Go to code.pyret.org and click <i>open editor</i> as you follow along the lecture. The book will cover everything he's doing like what a list is, what a function is, this is just a demonstration of the online interpreter. You can run Pyret <a href="https://www.pyret.org/set-sail/">offline</a> too. 
</p>

<p>
Notice he shuts down a lot of out of scope questions to not derail the lecture.  
</p>

<p>
@34:20 is the private app Exemplar which we don't have access to, and is usually an extra assignment on homework. The idea is that the students are given a task 'write a program that calculates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median">median</a> of data in a list'. They start by writing the tests first before implementing the program, to get you to think about the problem. The exemplar app already has a working (and purposely buggy) implementation of the assignment that they can't see the source code for which is where the 'chaffs' are found (potential bugs caught). We will just have to write a lot of tests ourselves, covering enough cases until we've fleshed out the problem enough that we can go about implementing it. 
</p>

<p>
So how can we figure out the student given test cases for the median program? By looking up what a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median">median</a> is and the procedure to find it. Reading that article we see that the median is a value that seperates a finite list of numbers, that can be found by arranging them from the smallest to the greatest. If there is an odd number of entries, the middle number that splits the list into two even parts is picked. Otherwise it is defined to be the mean of the two middle values which means add them both and divide by 2, the idea being getting as close as possible to evenly splitting the data. That's why the test for [list: 1, 3, 2] is 2 because your program would reorder the list to be [list: 1, 2, 3] and choose 2 as the median. The Fermi problems he talks about must be released on Piazza which requires campus logins, <a href="https://piazza.com/class">https://piazza.com/class</a> is a kind of wiki/msg forum for courses that encourages anonymous postings so students don't feel embarassed to ask questions. A lot of universities now solely distribute their course materials through it meaning the public doesn't have access anymore. You can find these yourself online anyway by searching for Fermi problems. 
</p>

<p>
At the end he mentions the design recipe, as a way to save TAs time, explaining if you show up to office hours for help they will go about writing a template with the student, going through all the various stages and not just giving them an answer. He notes it is totally optional to use the design recipe, but it will help you with the hard assignments and if you're going to office hours with a lot of questions clearly your methods aren't working so why not try their method. If you read that <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/rkf-student-ta-hours/">paper</a> <i>What Help Do Students Seek in TA Office Hours</i> in the beginning of this workshop you'll see statistical results of the outcomes of students who used the design recipe vs those that didn't and their final grades. 
</p>

<p>
Templates are covered in the third lecture, it's a tool to extract 'code for free' from your data and will be useful for some of the assignments.

<p>
Let's work through the <a href="https://papl.cs.brown.edu/2019/index.html">book</a> starting at the beginning, I'm using whatever the latest version is (as of this writing, 2019). This book is a work in progress so you'll see some minor errors like "REF" which is supposed to later be a link to whatever reference in the text that's not finished yet. The lectures we do will fill in these blanks.
</p>

<p>
Chapter 2 <i>Basic Data and Expressions</i> read while you have the pyret interpreter at code.pyret.org open.

Already we are introduced to built-in functions, such as num-expt. To understand these, let's read the <a href="https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/Builtins_and_Libraries.html">documentation</a>. If you have a small screen, you will need to turn your device to landscape or increase the browser window size in order to see the table of contents in the pyret docs which automatically hide depending on screen size and is annoying UI. 
</p>

<p>
Find the number functions <a href="https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/numbers.html#(part._.Number_.Functions)">documentation</a> by hitting Ctrl-F in your browser or otherwise searching the page for 'num-expt'. Here is how you <a href="https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/numbers.html#(part._numbers_num-expt)">read</a> it. The "::" syntax refers to type expected, so num-expt(base :: Number, exponent :: Number) -&gt; Number is annotation telling you this built-in requires two inputs: a base and an exponent of type number, and it outputs a number. This will be explained in chapter 3. Repeat looking in the documentation to understand what string-subtring() does. Try changing the examples yourself in the REPL as you go.

<p>
In the documentation under <a href="https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/lists.html">lists</a> you will see additional built-in functions called methods. These have a dot notation such as .length() or .map(). What this means is the object itself, a list object, has features you can access directly. If your list is named my-list then you can access these by my-list.length() or by chaining them together, such as my-list.sort().length() to both sort and return the length of a list. Try this yourself in the REPL.

The last section on roughnums, where irrational numbers like the square root of two return different values is due to floating point approximation that by default use a 'round to even' rounding strategy which if you wanted you could learn from this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVg_tUyyQzA&amp;list=PL3swII2vlVoVspHvAYIvnbbqdV8oEuxkw&amp;index=5&amp;t=0s">lecture</a> but it assumes a technical background we don't have yet, namely that you've completed all the other lectures in that playlist and an introductory programming course, which we are doing right now. The final exercise <i>Do roughnums obey the axioms of arithmetic operators like distributivity, associativity and commutativity?</i> you can tell immediately from the examples in the book that roughnums are always returning different values, so a + b does not equal b + a if the numbers are roughnums. Think to yourself what would happen if you used floating point to encode money in financial software, with unpredictable results if some trade combination resulted in a roughnum. Oops

You spent all of chapter 2 entering commands into the REPL on the right hand side of the pyret online editor, now you'll use the left hand side to write functions and run them by either pressing Ctrl-Enter or the <i>Run</i> button. In 3.5 <i>Defining Functions in Steps</i> notice he changes the tests to not just return the expected value, but to return the expected computation, writing out in full what should be happening. The idea of doing this is to help you write the function. These aren't tests to prove it is correct, they are tests to help understand the full domain of the problem so we can write a model for it with software. 
</p>

<p>
I'm assuming you're doing all the exercises. Let's walk through the 'has-overtime' raises exercise.
</p>

<pre class="example">
fun has-overtime(hours :: Number) -&gt; Boolean:
  doc: "Returns true if hours &gt; 40 or returns false. Hours must be a positive number or error is raised"
  if hours &lt; 0:
    raise("hours must be greater than zero")
  else if hours &gt; 40:
      true
  else:
    false
  end
where:
  has-overtime(40) is false
  has-overtime(40.0001) is true
  has-overtime(-1) raises "hours must be greater than zero"
end
</pre>

<p>
Notice raise() is a built-in function. Where did I find how to use it? In the pyret language documentation. 
</p>

<p>
Let's write some tests for the last exercise hours-to-wages-ot as an example of how writing tests helps to define the problem better, and helps write the program for you. We have to write a function that consumes hours, an hourly rate, a threshold for OT, and returns anything over that threshold at 1.5 times the rate, adding it to the total pay. 
</p>

<p>
First, let's write the parameters:
</p>
<pre class="example">
fun hours-to-wage-ot(hours :: Number, rate :: Number, threshold :: Number) -&gt; Number:
  doc: "Calculates total pay with all hours over threshold at 1.5 the rate"
where:
end
</pre>
<p>
now let's write the tests:
</p>
<pre class="example">
where:
 hours-to-wage-ot(10, 1, 40) is 10 * 1
 hours-to-wage-ot(41, 1, 40) is (40 * 1) + (1 * (1 * 1.5))
 hours-to-wage-ot(50, 20, 48) is (48 * 20) + ((50 - 48) * (20 * 1.5))
end
</pre>

<p>
Keep writing test cases where you don't just write the final expected result, but how you would arrive at that result. Notice all I did here was copy the last test case, and the first test case to the function body:
</p>
<pre class="example">
fun hours-to-wages-ot(hours :: Number, rate :: Number, threshold :: Number) -&gt; Number:
  doc: "Calculates pay with all hours over threshold at 1.5 the rate"
  if hours &gt; threshold:
    (threshold * rate) + ((hours - threshold) * (rate * 1.5))
  else:
    hours * rate
  end
where:
  hours-to-wages-ot(10, 1, 40) is 10 * 1
  hours-to-wages-ot(41, 1, 40) is (40 * 1) + (1 * (1 * 1.5))
  hours-to-wages-ot(50, 20, 48) is (48 * 20) + ((50 - 48) * (20 * 1.5))
end
</pre>

Watch the Mon9/10/18 second lecture. Interesting lecture about the rainfall problem and the benefits of writing a lot of examples in order to understand badly defined problems. Data science/machine learning is brought up, as examples of dirty data. Higher-order functions are talked about, like filter and map which are in the pyret documentation. We're going to write our own versions of map, filter and fold after we cover Chapter 6 <i>Processing Lists</i>.

This is an interesting and short chapter how you would go about converting data to rows. There's nothing in here you can't already figure out now that you know how to read the documentation for pyret. The goal here is not to memorize all the built-in functions of Pyret but just gain extra experience changing the examples, and learning how to take data and make it into a program. The text also expects you to start reading documentation, not telling you how to assign a table to a variable so you can run all those sieve expressions on it. See the docs and change the examples in the text as you go to see what they do:
</p>

<pre class="example">
my-table = table: name, age
  row: "Alice", 30
  row: "Bob", 40
  row: "Carol", 25
end

sieve my-table using name:
  name == 'Carol'
end

order my-table:
  name ascending
end
</pre>

<p>
This is similar to <a href="https://n0x400.1mb.dev/#org268f85c">SQL syntax</a>, where you just declare what you want to do to rows and columns instead of how to do it. 4.2.6 selecting syntax is exactly like SQL syntax. Congrats you know some SQL now. In 4.2.7 the <i>principle of orthogonality</i> comment on why they composed these table row operations to be independent of each other so combining them in complex expressions is possible.

<p>
<i>Do Now</i> from 4.2.3. We are asked to think about how to write two questions, the first one is given to us so I tried the second which asks <i>Of the songs by a particular artist, which have we played the least often?</i>" using only what we've seen so far: 
</p>

<pre class="example">
my-playlist = 
  table: artist, song, playcount
    row: "Lustre", "The First Snow", 10
    row: "Lustre", "Green Worlds", 1
    row: "Lustre", "Welcome Winter", 2
  end

order my-playlist:
  playcount ascending
end
</pre>

<p>
Second Exercise <i>Write the second example as a composition of keep and order operations on a playlist table</i>.
</p>

<pre class="example">
my-playlist = 
  table: artist, song, playcount
    row: "Lustre", "The First Snow", 10
    row: "Lustre", "Green Worlds", 1
    row: "Lustre", "Welcome Winter", 2
  end

composition = order my-playlist:
  playcount ascending
end

sieve composition using playcount:
  playcount &lt;= 1
end
</pre>

<p>
Read ahead and play around with this, maybe you just want to return the song name, not the artist name and playcount, experiment with the documentation on your own:
</p>

<pre class="example">
my-playlist = 
  table: artist, song, playcount
    row: "Lustre", "The First Snow", 10
    row: "Lustre", "Green Worlds", 1
    row: "Lustre", "Welcome Winter", 2
  end

least-played = order my-playlist:
  playcount ascending

select song, playcount from least-played end

In 5.3.1 the description of the properties of an 'anonymous value' abstraction by using numbers and asking what they mean is similar to Terence Tao's <i>Linear Algebra</i> text where he points out that a property of numbers that makes them useful is their ability to be interpreted differently depending on context. 
</p>

<p>
A <i>Do Now</i> appears. This means we should actually do it. Try to sieve our playlist to show the most played song using built-in language functions from the math or statistics library: 
</p>

<pre class="example">
include math

my-playlist = 
  table: artist, song, playcount
    row: "Lustre", "The First Snow", 10
    row: "Lustre", "Green Worlds", 1
    row: "Lustre", "Welcome Winter", 2
  end

play-count = extract playcount from my-playlist end
most-played-count = max(play-count)

sieve my-playlist using playcount:
  playcount == most-played-count
end
</pre>

<p>
Lists are introduced, which is the datastructure we will be using for a lot of the exercises. 
</p>

<p>
Important: the Exercise in 5.4.2 <i>Implement all the other statistical questions posed in Basic Statistical Questions</i> is mandatory. They look easy after reading the book examples, and you definitely will think to yourself 'oh I already know this, time to move on' but you only learn by doing. Remember experts in learning have constructed this book and course and know exactly what you need to do in order to be successful in completing it. There will always be one or two questions in there that will stump you a little and require research to solve the exercise and when you figure it out you will never forget how you found that solution whereas if you skip this exercise, you'll promptly forget in a few days time. So let's look at them:
</p>

<p>
'keep-if' likely is supposed to be sieve as per 4.2.1 Keeping or another command you write to filter a table and keep results. Remember the warning from 1.3 The Structure of This Book: <i>"We will include mistakes, not because we don’t know better, but because this is the best way for you to learn. Including mistakes makes it impossible for you to read passively: you must instead engage with the material, because you can never be sure of the veracity of what you’re reading"</i>. 
</p>

<p>
Let's go through 5.1 <i>Basic Statistical Questions</i> but using our my-playlist as an example. These will all be functions on lists, because we use the extract built-in function to remove this information from a table and returns a list.
</p>

<pre class="example">
# notice these import statements so we can use these built-in function
include math
include statistics
import lists as L

my-playlist = 
  table: artist, song, playcount
    row: "Lustre", "The First Snow", 10
    row: "Lustre", "Green Worlds", 1
    row: "Lustre", "Welcome Winter", 2
  end

# From 5.1 Basic Stat Questions:
# Question 1, 2, and 3 are the same: the maximum or largest value
# To see what these datastructures look like, type 'play-count' into REPL
play-count = extract playcount from my-playlist end
most-played-count = max(play-count)

sieve my-playlist using playcount:
  playcount == most-played-count
end

# Smallest value in a column 
least-played-count = min(play-count)

# Number of songs in a playlist
# Since we have extracted a list, we just need to count the length of the list using a built-in function
# using: play-count = extract playcount from my-playlist end
play-count.length()

# All the distinct entries in playcount column
# Another built-in from lists documentation
# Notice import lists as L, you can call this something else 'import lists as whatever' 
L.distinct(play-count)

# The number of distinct entries in a playcount column
# Asking us: count how many entries are distinct
# Note we are chaining built-ins together here:
L.distinct(play-count).length()

# The average, this is another built-in, from this exact chapter
avg-play-count = mean(play-count)

# Other statistics
# Just replace x(play-count) with that built-in from the statistics library 
modes-play-count = modes(play-count)
median-play-count = median(play-count)
stdev-play-count = stdev(play-count)
</pre>

<p>
That was a little tedious but it taught us how to look up documentation, how to use import or include statements.

<p>
We need to understand this chapter to follow along with the rest of the lectures, and for future assignments. 6.1 you can type all those examples in the REPL to see what they do, like manually linking a list together with link. 
</p>



<p>
6.2 Let's make some list functions:
</p>

<pre class="example">

# Examples first. List&lt;Any&gt; means will accept any type (string, number)
# Length only counts the number of items, not nested list items:
fun my-len(l :: List&lt;Any&gt;) -&gt; Number:
  doc:"Returns the length of a list"
  check:
    my-len([list: ]) is 0
    my-len([list: 1, 2, 3]) is 3
    my-len([list: 1, [list: 1, 2], 99]) is 3
    my-len([list: [list: empty], 1]) is 2
  end
end

# From these examples we can build the function:
fun my-len(l :: List&lt;Any&gt;) -&gt; Number:
  doc:"Returns the length of a list"
  cases (List) l:
    | empty =&gt; 0
    | link(f, r) =&gt; 1 + my-len(r)
  end
end
check:
  my-len([list: ]) is 0
  my-len([list: 1, 2, 3]) is 3
  my-len([list: 1, [list: 1, 2], 99]) is 3
  my-len([list: [list: empty], 1]) is 2
end
</pre>

<p>
This is how my-len() is evaluated if you call my-len() with list 1, 2, 3:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>my-len([list: 1,2,3])</li>
<li>1 + my-len([list: 2, 3])</li>
<li>1 + (1 + my-len([list: 3]))</li>
<li>1 + (1 + (1 + my-len([list: empty])))</li>
<li>1 + 1 + 1 + 0 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>= 3</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<p>
Let's do another 6.2 list exercise:
</p>
<pre class="example">
# Compute the sum of a list (of numbers)
# Start with examples, and run your examples just to make sure they are well formed/syntax
fun my-sum(l :: List&lt;Number&gt;) -&gt; Number:
  doc: "Returns the sum of numbers in a list"
  check:
    my-sum([list: ]) is 0
    my-sum([list: 1, 2, 3]) is 6
    my-sum([list: -1, -2]) is -3
    my-sum([list: [list: ], [list: 2, 3], 3]) is 8
    my-sum([list: 2]) is 2
  end
end

# Let's try and write this
fun my-sum(l :: List&lt;Number&gt;) -&gt; Number:
  doc: "Returns the sum of numbers in a list"
  cases (List) l:
    | empty =&gt; 0
    | link(f, r) =&gt; f + my-sum(r)
  end
end
  check:
    my-sum([list: ]) is 0
    my-sum([list: 1, 2, 3]) is 6
    my-sum([list: -1, -2]) is -3
    my-sum([list: [list: ], [list: 2, 3], 3]) is 8
    my-sum([list: 2]) is 2
  end

</pre>

<p>
One test failed! It didn't count the nested list. We weren't expected to write functions that can handle deeply nested lists or anything, but for learning purposes let's see if we can anyway. What does the built-in sum return:
</p>

<pre class="example">
import math
sum([list: 3, 3, [list: 2, 3]])
</pre>

<p>
It fails too, so let's clean the data first 
</p>

<pre class="example">
import lists as L

fun my-sum(l :: List&lt;Number&gt;) -&gt; Number:
  doc: "Returns the sum of numbers in a list"
  cases (List) l:
    | empty =&gt; 0
    | link(f, r) =&gt; f + my-sum(r)
  end
end
check:
  my-sum([list: ]) is 0
  my-sum([list: 1, 2, 3]) is 6
  my-sum([list: -1, -2]) is -3
# new call here:
  my-sum(clean-data([list: ], [list: [list: ], [list: 2, 3], 3])) is 8
  my-sum([list: 2]) is 2
end

# .filter() function no-empty is below
# is-link is built-in, see documentation
fun clean-data(l1 :: List&lt;Any&gt;, l2 :: List&lt;Any&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;Any&gt;:
  doc: "Removes nested lists, call with clean-data(empty-list, list-to-clean)"
  cases (List) l2:
    | empty =&gt; l1.filter(no-empty)
    | link(f, r) =&gt;
      if is-link(f):
        temp = L.append(l1, f)
        clean-data(temp, r)           
      else:
        temp = l1.push(f)
        clean-data(temp, r)
      end
  end
end

# .filter(function) if boolean == true then only those items will be returned
fun no-empty(l3 :: List&lt;Any&gt;) -&gt; Boolean:
 doc: "Predicate for empty case clean-data() filter"

# try to implement yourself, could even do if is-empty(l3): false else: true 
end
</pre>
<p>
How clean-data() evals is test if f == a list structure, if it does we append the entire embedded list to an accumulator, and then loop again with the accumulator now becoming parameter 'l1' input. On the empty case you return the accumulator, which here is l1 filtered to remove any [list: empty] using the .filter() built-in you can read about in the documentation. Try implementing the rest of the functions in 6.2 as the more practice you have doing this the easier the lectures and assignments will be. Note this is not an efficient solution, just it's the easiest demonstration. 
</p>

<p>
If this doesn't make sense step by hand through clean-data():
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>clean-data(l1, list-to-clean)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>l1 is empty when first called</li>
</ul></li>
<li>is f == to a list datastructure? if so append the whole embedded list to temp-list and loop again</li>
<li>clean-data(temp-list, rest-of-list-to-clean)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>temp-list is now l1</li>
</ul></li>
<li>if f is not an embedded list, then push the value of f to l1 and assign it to temp-list again</li>
<li>if we reach end of list-to-clean, filter for any empties and return l1, the fully cleaned list</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6dfe3f0">
<p>
Let's try the first <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs019/2018/docdiffdocdiff.html">assignment</a>. One way to slog through a long chapter on list functions is to actually implement something using lists, then we can refer to it as reference. In other words it becomes a research project to read that we are more motivated to do since we're trying to complete a task. You could also try watching Lecture 3 first before doing this assignment if you're unsure of how recursion on lists works. 
</p>

<p>
This assignment looks difficult on purpose but is easy to implement. You're just translating instructions. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product#Algebraic_definition">dot product</a> algebraic definition, look at the example for [1,3,-5] x [4,-2,-1]. Each index in the first list is multiplied by it's corresponding index in the second list, then those results are added together. To read the sigma notation, a*b = the sum of \(a_ib_i\) starting at index 1 (first element of the list) up to the length of the list (n):
</p>

<details>
<p>
If a = [1, 3, -5] and b = [4, -2, -1]:
</p>

<p>
\(a*b = \sum_{i=1}^3 a_ib_i\) = (\(1_{a1} * 4_{b1})+(3_{a2} * -2_{b2})+(-5_{a3} * -1_{b3})\)
</p>
</details>

<p>
Some more requirements are listed, such as ignoring the case (upper/lower) of a letter when counting it's number of occurences. The exact equation for overlap is given: dot-product(doc1, doc2) / num-max(num-sqr(magnitude(doc1)), num-sqr(magnitude(doc2))) assuming you converted both doc1/doc2 to vectors already.

I almost posted too much of the answer, breaking my own rule on not posting answers so they don't lock away the assignments. Note my implementation is missing tests, doesn't follow the whole requirements (such as upper/lower case ignoring) and doesn't follow the Pyret <a href="https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/Pyret_Style_Guide.html">style guide</a>. This assignment is much shorter and easier to do with higher-order functions, which we will take shortly.

<p>
We're watching Wed9/12/18 lecture on sorting. These videos you can download in 1920x1080 if you want and zoom if you can't see the writing on the whiteboard. 
</p>

<p>
He walks through exactly what a template is and how to extract data to make a template, and spends the rest of the class writing insertion sort using only what we already know so far. You have to hand step through it a little to understand what insertion sort is doing. Function sort() is calling insert() with insert(f, sort(r)) it isn't calling insert(f, r) to just hand it the rest of the list. 
</p>

<p>
Let's step the evaluation by hand with [list: 0, 1, 3, 2] being input to sort(). The following calls to insert happen:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>insert(0,(insert(1,(insert(3,(insert(2, [list: empty])))))))</li>
</ul>

<p>
It's like our example with my-len() with 1 + 1 + etc. Evaluation starts at the deepest inner bracket:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>insert(2, [list: empty])
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>is list empty? link(2, link(empty))</li>
<li>return to sort(): [list: 2, empty]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>insert(3, [list: 2, empty])
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>is 3 &lt; 2?</li>
<li>link(2, insert(3, [list: empty]))</li>
<li>return to sort(): [list: 2, 3, empty]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>insert(1, [list: 2, 3, empty])
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>is 1 &lt; 2?</li>
<li>then it must the smallest in the entire list:</li>
<li>link(1, [list: 2, 3, empty])</li>
<li>return to sort(): [list: 1, 2, 3, empty]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>insert(0, [list: 1, 2, 3, empty])
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>is 0 &lt; 1?</li>
<li>link(0, [list: 1, 2, 3, empty])</li>
<li>return to sort(): [list: 0, 1, 2, 3, empty]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>no more delayed computations, sort() is finished</li>
</ul>

<p>
The returns to sort():
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>insert(0,(insert(1,(insert(3, [list: 2, empty])))))</li>
<li>insert(0,(insert(1, [list: 2, 3, empty])))</li>
<li>insert(0, [list: 1, 2, 3, empty])</li>
</ul>

<p>
Everytime a list is returned, the next call to insert can happen because it is complete with insert(n, list).

<h3 id="org8f0d1ef">Lab: Higher-Order Functions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8f0d1ef">
<p>
Let's do the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs019/2016/hofs-lab.pdf">lab</a> on functions as data, and write our own map, filter and fold. 
</p>

<pre class="example">
fun fun-plus-one(num :: Number, func :: (Number -&gt; Number)) -&gt; Number:
  func(num) + 1
end

&gt;&gt;fun-plus-one(16, num-sqr)
&gt;&gt;5
</pre>

<p>
Try entering various built-ins, or one you wrote yourself, as the second parameter to fun-plus-one.
</p>

<p>
<b>Map</b>
</p>

<p>
We're given test cases and asked to implement f-to-c and goldilocks, and given the formula for f to c temperature unit conversion.
</p>

<pre class="example">
fun f-to-c(f-lst :: List&lt;Number&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;Number&gt;:
  cases (List) f-lst:
    | empty =&gt; empty
    | link(f, r) =&gt; 
      link((f - 32) * (5/9), f-to-c(r))
  end
end

fun goldilocks(f-lst :: List&lt;Number&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;String&gt;:
  cases (List) f-lst:
    | empty =&gt; empty
    | link(f, r) =&gt;
      if f &gt; 90:
        link("too hot", goldilocks(r))
      else if f &lt; 70:
        link("too cold", goldilocks(r))
      else:
        link("just right", goldilocks(r))
      end
  end
end
check:
  f-to-c([list: 131, 77, 68]) is [list: 55, 25, 20]
  goldilocks([list: 131, 77, 68]) is [list: "too hot", "just right", "too cold"]
end
</pre>

<p>
We're asked to rewrite goldilocks using map. The data dumped into a map function is whatever the value is at that list index. In this case we know it's a number since f-lst parameter is :: List&lt;Number&gt;.
</p>

<pre class="example">
fun goldilocks2(f-lst :: List&lt; Number&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;String&gt;:
  f-lst.map({(x): if x &gt; 90: "too hot" else if x &lt; 70: "too cold" else: "just right" end})
end
check:
  goldilocks2([list: 131, 77, 68]) is [list: "too hot", "just right", "too cold"]
end
</pre>

<p>
.map() is a built-in method on a list, where f-lst.map() means we are mapping over f-lst. I used the shorthand syntax for lambdas.
</p>

<p>
We could have also rewritten it like the following example, where a seperate function is used for map instead of writing our own lambda:
</p>

<pre class="example">
fun goldilocks(x :: Number) -&gt; String:
  if x &gt; 90:
    "too hot"
  else if x &lt; 70:
    "too cold"
  else:
    "just right"
  end
end

fun goldilocks2(f-lst :: List&lt; Number&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;String&gt;:
  map(goldilocks, f-lst)
end
check:
  goldilocks2([list: 131, 77, 68]) is [list: "too hot", "just right", "too cold"]
end
</pre>

<p>
Now our task is write our own version of map(). I just used the documentation examples for map as check tests. Remember map consumes a function and a list, applies the function to each entry in the list returning a new list, try to do this yourself before looking at a solution (your solution may be better). For annotations, I used the <a href="https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/s_annotations.html#(part._s~3aname-ann)">built-in</a> name annotations but if you read through the documentation you can also import annotations, or create your own datatype. 
</p>

<details>
<pre class="example">
fun my-map(func :: (Any -&gt; Any), l :: List&lt;Any&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;Any&gt;:
  cases (List) l:
    | empty =&gt; empty
    | link(f, r) =&gt;
      link(func(f), my-map(func, r))
  end
end
check:
  my-map(num-tostring, [list: 1, 2]) is [list: "1", "2"]
  my-map(lam(x): x + 1 end, [list: 1, 2]) is [list: 2, 3]
end
</pre>
</details>

<p>
<b>Filter</b>
</p>

<p>
First two assignments are straight forward to get you to used to using filter, except you have to use string-to-code-points() instead of any built-in string functions. 
</p>

<details>
<pre class="example">
fun tl-dr(lol :: List&lt;Any&gt;, length-thresh :: Number) -&gt; List&lt;Any&gt;:
  filter(lam(element): string-to-code-points(element).length() &lt;= length-thresh end, lol)
end
check:
  tl-dr([list: "dkfjdkj", "hi", "dkfjk"], 2) is [list: "hi"]
  tl-dr([list: "corner", "case", ""], 2) is [list: ""]
  tl-dr([list: "a", "b", "c"], 0) is [list: ]
end

# I got '101' from entering string-code-points("e") in the REPL
# See comments below, you would not want to write code this way
fun eliminate-e(words :: List&lt;Any&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;Any&gt;:
  filter(lam(element): if string-to-code-points(element).member(101) or
    string-to-code-points(element).member(69): false else: true end end, words)
end
check:
  eliminate-e([list: "e"]) is [list: ]
  eliminate-e([list: "there's", "no", "letter", "e", "here"]) is [list: "no"]
  eliminate-e([list: "hello", "everybody"]) is [list: ]
  eliminate-e([list: "E", "101", "!!!"]) is [list: "101", "!!!"]
end

</pre>
</details>

<p>
A much cleaner way to implement eliminate-e() would be to filter once extracting all the strings in the list with "e" and/or "E" in them, then filter again and using that list as a predicate to filter the original. Lambda identifiers should be short: filter(lam(x): x &gt; 1 end) as it's immediately evident what that parameter is, as the 'scope' of that function is only the filter. Try writing that better solution. 
</p>

<p>
Task: implement our own version of filter, which is similar to what we did for map:
</p>

<details>
<pre class="example">
fun my-filter(func :: (Any -&gt; Boolean), l :: List&lt;Any&gt;) -&gt;List&lt;Any&gt;:
  cases (List) l:
    | empty =&gt; empty
    | link(f, r) =&gt;
      if func(f):
        link(f, my-filter(func, r))
      else:
        my-filter(func, r)
      end
  end
end
check:
  fun length-is-one(s :: String) -&gt; Boolean:
    string-length(s) == 1
  end
  my-filter(length-is-one, [list: "ab", "a", "", "c"]) is [list: "a", "c"]
  my-filter(is-link, [list: empty, link(1, empty), empty]) is [list: link(1, empty)]
end
</pre>
</details>

<p>
<b>Fold</b>
</p>

<p>
The two tasks: list-product and list-max should be easy for you by now:
</p>

<details>
<pre class="example">

fun list-product(lon :: List&lt;Number&gt;) -&gt; Number:
  fold(lam(acc, n): acc * n end, 1, lon)
end
check:
  list-product([list: 2, 2, 2]) is 8
  list-product([list: 0, 1, 2]) is 0
  list-product([list: -1, -1]) is 1
end

fun list-max(lon :: List&lt;Number&gt;) -&gt; Number:
  fold(lam(acc, n): if n &gt; acc: n else: acc end end, 0, lon)
end
check:
  list-max([list: -1, 1, 2]) is 2
  list-max([list: 0, -100, 1]) is 1
  list-max([list: 1/2, 3/4]) is 3/4
end
</pre>
</details>

<p>
Try implementing fold yourself before you look at my solution, use the check tests for fold in the pyret documentation to test your solution.
</p>

<details>
<pre class="example">
fun my-fold(func :: (Any -&gt; Any), acc :: Any, l :: List&lt;Any&gt;) -&gt; Any:
  cases (List) l:
    | empty =&gt; acc
    | link(f, r) =&gt;
      temp = func(acc, f)
      my-fold(func, temp, r)
  end
end
check:
  my-fold((lam(acc, elt): acc + elt end), 0, [list: 3, 2, 1]) is 6
  my-fold((lam(acc, elt): acc + elt end), 10, [list: 3, 2, 1]) is 16
  fun combine(acc, elt) -&gt; String:
    tostring(elt) + " - " + acc
  end
  my-fold(combine, "END", [list: 3, 2, 1]) is "1 - 2 - 3 - END"
  my-fold(combine, "END", empty) is "END"
end
</pre>
</details>

<p>
<b>Map2</b>
</p>

<p>
The task for implementing who-passed is straight forward to figure out, the second task we're asked to write map2 ourselves. 
</p>

<details>
<pre class="example">

# link(ff, rr) and link(f, r) can be called anything:
# ie: link(head-first, tail-first) or link(head-second, tail-second)
fun my-map2(func :: (Any -&gt; Any), list1 :: List&lt;Any&gt;, list2 :: List&lt;Any&gt;) -&gt; List&lt;Any&gt;:
  cases (List) list1:
    | empty =&gt; empty
    | link(f, r) =&gt;
      cases (List) list2:
        | empty =&gt; empty
        | link(ff, rr) =&gt;
          link(func(f, ff), my-map2(func, r, rr))
      end
  end
end
check:
  my-map2(string-append, [list: "mis", "mal"], [list: "fortune", "practice"])
    is [list: "misfortune", "malpractice"]
  my-map2(_ + _, [list: "mis", "mal"], [list: "fortune", "practice"])
    is [list: "misfortune", "malpractice"]
  my-map2(string-append, [list: "mis", "mal"], [list: "fortune"])
    is [list: "misfortune"]
  my-map2(string-append, [list: "mis", "mal"], empty)
    is empty
end
</pre>
</details>

<p>
The last task, best-price, look on youtube what a basic demand function is. Here's an example:
</p>

<pre class="example">
fun demand(price-increase :: Number) -&gt; Number:
 doc: "1000 is approx demand of product at a fixed price"
  1000 - (60 * price-increase)
end
</pre>

<p>
This means as the price increases, the quantity demanded will decrease by 60 units times the price increase, so if the price increase is 1, the demand is 1000 - 60. Your best-price function can take a list of price increases, the demand function, then map over the price list w/the demand function, to get a new list of adjusted demand vs price increase. Map over the adjusted demand with the price list to produce the forecast revenue, which is price * qty demanded. Then figure out how to use a combo of filter/fold in order to return just the optimal price increase or write a helper function, inside the best-price function for the higher-order functions to use. The reasons for using a helper function is so you get access to the scope of the parent function, so any locally lived variables in that parent function you can pass into the helper function.

In the next lecture of cs019, we will cover how to estimate complexity of a program, and then apply that to all future lectures and assignments. Here we will do the same, learn about how reasoning with contracts can help us write better code and then apply it to all future code. We will also learn exactly how numbers are represented in a computer, which is everyday knowledge we should know when later we have to work in Python for an AI course.

</p>

<p>
Click on 'Enter course' and you should see Syllabus: 15-122 Imperative Programming Aug-Dec 2018. It consists of three units on integers (how two's complement works, bit shifting) and one unit on contracts which is a method for proving correctness of loops and interfaces. One of the professors has a short talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNITrPhl2_A">here</a> outlining the benefits of contracts. 
</p>

<p>
Let's start with module 2 <a href="https://oli.cmu.edu/jcourse/webui/syllabus/module.do?context=8b1d319f0a0001dc31d2bc08deee1c13">representing integers</a>:
</p>

<p>
The Hindu-Arabic numeral system is introduced which if you've taken the <a href="https://learnaifromscratch.github.io/math.html">math</a> foundations beside this programming workshop you already know about. The summation notation for converting binary numbers to decimals: below the sigma (the greek E symbol, which means sum) is the starting index 0. Above the sigma is the range, which is n - 1 since we are beginning at zero, if you wish to sum 4 binary numbers then you want 0 through 3 (0, 1, 2, 3 is 4 digits). \(b_i2^i\) is where you plug in the starting index. The b variable (base) is either 0 or 1 since this is binary:
</p>

<p>
\(b_{0}2^0 + b_{1}2^1 + b_{2}2^2\)&#x2026; for binary number 0101 is (1 * \(2^0\))+(0 * \(2^1\))+(1 * \(2^2\))+(0 * \(2^3\)) as you start from the right of the binary number and sum left. This will make sense when you do the 'do now' exercise.
</p>

<p>
Horner's rule I haven't seen outside of a Don Knuth text, interesting they put it in this course. You evaluate by starting with the deepest nested brackets and working to the right. Try it on paper. The example you eval the multiplication first then addition: (2 + 1) x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 (+ 1) which is 3 x 2 (6) x 2 (12) x 2 (24) x 2 (48) + 1 = 49. Note the 'significant bit' in the example of evaluating 10010110 with Horner's rule (the leftmost bit).

<h2 id="orgb4d853d">Cryptopals challenges</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb4d853d">
<p>
Using only what we know so far (how to read Pyret docs, how to use higher order function) try completing a few of the <a href="https://cryptopals.com/">cryptopals</a> challenges to learn about how real-world crypto is attacked. Model the bytes however you want, I used strings because we haven't covered making our own datatypes yet for type binary, and if you use numbers Pyret will truncate binary 0001 to just 1. These challenges were designed so you write most of the modeling yourself.
</p>

<p>
Before you begin, you probably need to know the basics of bytes, boolean algebra and hex encoding. See 15-122 Imperative Programming.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://cryptopals.com/sets/1/challenges/1">Challenge 1</a> - Convert hex to base64: we're given two encoded strings, one encoded in hex and the other in base64 and we are asked to operate only on raw bytes. Since we're using a web editor, I decided to model this with strings, and a string-dict which is in the Pyret documentation. Wikipedia has all the info needed to generate hex encoded or base64 which instead of 4 bits uses 6 bits, and has a padding scheme which is detailed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#Examples">here</a>. In that example, the character 'M' is 0100 1101 (8 bits) but base64 is 6 bits, so it pads four zeros for a total of 12 bits for the encoding which will be 2 base64 characters. You can check for this with built-in <a href="https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/numbers.html#(part._numbers_num-modulo)">num-modulo</a>. If you're wondering how num-modulo(-7, 3) is 2, see this short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRYsae9g3i8&amp;feature=youtu.be">video</a> on the mod operator. The first largest value of 3 bigger than -7 is -9, and the result is the distance between them which is 2.

Build a function that takes the hex string as input, and outputs the binary representation, such as using string-explode() to make a list out of each character, and then map over the exploded list with hex-to-binary-dict.get-value(x) (see documentation for string-dict). You could also write a function make-bytes() that turns an exploded list of single bits into 4, 6 or 8 bits.

<p>
In Challenge 3, trying to find out which character has been XOR'd against the given hex encoded string, you can see Norvig's <a href="https://norvig.com/mayzner.html">word frequency</a> post. Your program can take the 1 byte ASCII <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/03/14/eb/0314ebabbc3f4a6a756828a78f40a98e.png">character</a> (ie: 01010000 is "P") and only test XOR'ing the common words, then checking if the result is a member of the much larger original. You avoid having to xor the entire original string every try. Use the repeat() function for strings to multiply a single character's byte representation to the same size of the word's byte representation. Map2 over them with your own xor function.
