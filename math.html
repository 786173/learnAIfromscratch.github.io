This is a (ongoing) workshop to learn the math needed for various prereqs in university AI intro courses, and is Part IB of the <a href="https://learnaifromscratch.github.io">AI Tripos</a>. No background is assumed. The idea here is that you do this workshop until you can figure out the courses in the AI workshop and then can either continue doing both or switch, up to you. We start by writing proofs of basic arithmetic with the natural numbers and work our way up. Proof writing is a skill you practice like every other skill, if you persist and practice it enough eventually you pick up the skill.  I watch a lecture one day, next day read some of a chapter, mainly 1 - 2 hrs a day sometimes less or more on the weekends but I try and do it everyday.

<p>
If you can't figure out an exercise write it down in a notebook called 'Things I Don't Know' and every once in a while as you progress through more of the material, review your notebook of unsolved problems and see if you can now solve them. For proofs write out full sentences, it helps you remember the material and is the proper way you write a proof anyway. Don't just do scratch work and think you have the answer you'd be surprised how stuck you get when you try explaining it to yourself in the form of a written proof, it means you don't truly understand and need to either review the material again, or put that proof in your 'book of things I don't know' and go back to it later. 
</p>

<p>
If you write all your own examples everytime you come to a definition, you probably can easily do many of the exercises. Write them like you would example tests in the software workshop, find all the corner cases and see if the definition or lemma holds. Remember why we write examples in that workshop, it's to learn more about the problem domain since there may be subtle things that escaped our understanding. It's the same deal here.

<li>Distributive laws
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>k(n + m) = kn + km</li>
<li>(k + n)m = km + nm</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<p>
Exercise: Prove why the multiplication and distributive laws work. Since we have no idea what a proof is yet, we can instead try going through some of our own examples.   
</p>

<p>
Identity law: n \(\cdot\) 1 = n.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We are creating n groups of 1. According to our definition of multiplication |||| \(\cdot\) | would be 4 groups of | or ||||. This is still 4.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Commutative law: nm = mn. 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>||| \(\cdot\) || = || || || or 6. Rearranging this, || \(\cdot\) ||| is ||| ||| which is again 6.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Associative law: (kn)m = k(nm).  
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If k = |, and n = ||, and m = ||| and parens expressions are evaluated first:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Left side: (kn)m. We first evaluate (kn) as || (2 groups of 1, the identity law), and 2m is ||| ||| (2 groups of 3) for a total of 6.</li>
<li>Right side: k(nm): In the parens nm is 2 groups of 3, so ||| |||.  k(6) is the identity law, one group of 6. Thus (kn)m = k(nm).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Distributive law: (k + n)m = km + nm.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If k = ||||, and n = ||, and m = |:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Left side: (|||| + ||) is 6, and (6) x 1 is six groups of 1 or 6 according to the identity law.</li>
<li>Right side: km + nm: 4 groups of one is 4, plus two groups of 1 is 2 (identity law). Answer is again 6.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

We're still in the natural numbers, which he defined as beginning with 1 so we aren't working with zeros yet (no division by zero corner cases). He defines the operations of addition and multiplication with fractions using the laws of division we already learned. 
</p>

<p>
Note how he sets up the proof. The 'prime' notation (the tick, so c', a', b') represents another variable. You could rewrite this 'Suppose a/b = y/z so that a/z = b/y, and c/d = something/another, so that c/another = something/d does it then follow &#x2026;'.

What we are trying to prove is ab' = ba' and cd' = dc'. He introduces some extra notation, multiplying both sides by (dd') to help do this.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Axiom 2.1: 0 is a natural number</li>
<li>Axiom 2.2: If n is a natural number, then n++ is also a natural number</li>
<li>Axiom 2.3: 0 is not the successor of any natural number</li>
<li>Axiom 2.4: Different natural numbers must have different successors</li>
<li>Axiom 2.5: Let P(n) be any property pertaining to a natural number n. Suppose that P(0) is true, and suppose that whenever P(n) is true, P(n++) is also true. Then P(n) is true for every natural number n. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We make an assumption about a property P(n) being true meaning you do not prove P(n), you prove P(0) and P(n + 1) are true, and both these form a logical implication meaning that if they are both true, then your initial assumption of P(n) being true holds.</li>

<p>
Remark 2.1.10 and the template in Proposition 2.1.11 is probably the clearest definition of proof by induction I've seen. Note the example where no natural number can be 'a half number', because of the increment step n + 1. The base case of 0 (as per Axiom 2.5, and Axiom 2.1) fails if we are using 'half numbers' instead of natural numbers because if zero is a natural number, and any n++ is another natural number, the only next successive number is 1 it can't be 0.5 or -3 or 3/4. The way you should view these axioms about the natural numbers is:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>0 is an element of N</li>
<li>if x is an element of N, then so is x + 1.</li>
<li>nothing else is an element of N</li>

Proposition 2.1.16 (Recursive definitions) in the book <i>Analysis I</i>. Tao uses a function, it's definition can be read in chapter 3.3. Here \(a_0\) is function notation so \(a_0\) is \(f_0(0)\), \(a_1\) is \(f_1(1)\). This proposition is using a new function (a rule that maps from one input to one output) every time, I'm guessing to avoid sequences where they could repeat ie 0, 1, 1, 2, 3.. 
</p>

<p>
Let's do an example. 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(a_0\) becomes 0 (for c = 0)</li>
<li>\(a_{0++}\) becomes \(f_1(a_1)\) or 1</li>
<li>\(a_{1++}\) becomes \(f_2(a_2)\) or 2</li>
</ul>

<p>
The proof notes Axiom 2.3 protects the value \(a_0\) from being redefined by one of the functions. His base case for this proof is \({a_0}\) (Axiom 2.3) and he is assuming P(n) which is that the procedure will always give a single value to \({a_n}\). Axiom 2.4 is the inductive step, that this procedure will also give a single value to \(a_{m++}\). All of the Axioms are used to prove this. If this didn't make sense it will when we come back here in chapter 3.5 for an exercise.

<div id="outline-container-orga48858f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orga48858f">Aside: Induction and Recursion</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga48858f">
<p>
Induction and recursion are the same concept.  As an example, the specification of a program function twoExp(n) that when given a value n, returns \(2^n\). The examples you write for this program are as follows:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>twoExp(0) = 1</li>
<li>twoExp(1) = 2</li>
<li>twoExp(2) = 4</li>
<li>twoExp(3) = 8</li>
<li>twoExp(4) = 16</li>
<li>twoExp(5) = 32</li>
</ul>

<p>
You notice the pattern: the result of the next value, is 2x the previous value. twoExp(5) is 2 * twoExp(4). You write an algorithm using the above examples: if input = 0, then return 1, otherwise return 2 * twoExp(n-1). You make an assumption, that the input will always be non-negative. Walking through the program execution, twoExp(3) evaluates:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>2 * twoExp(3-1)</li>
<li>2 * (2 * twoExp(2-1))</li>
<li>2 * (2 * (2 * twoExp(1-1)))</li>
<li>2 * (2 * (2 * (1))) = \(2^3\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
To prove this by induction on n, we try the base case P(0). If n = 0 then twoExp(0) evaluates to 1, which is \(2^0\). What is P(n)? According to our recursive definition, n = 2*P where the value of P = twoExp(n-1) or \(2^{n-1}\). Our inductive step is n, since our algorithm is inductively defined n-1, and we wish to prove the successor n + 1, which is n. 2*P = \(2*2^{n-1}\) or \(2^n\). 
</p>

<p>
Note that we didn't have to do anything extra to prove this recursive function. That's because an inductive proof is a recursive function, and a recursive function is an inductive proof.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga6f4451">
<p>
Let's understand his example for addition. 3 + 5 should be the same as (((5++)++)++) and adding 0 to 5 should result in 5.  
</p>


<p>
Definition 2.2.1 notice he has a base case (0 + m is m), the hypotenuse "Suppose we inductively defined how to add n to m" which we saw at the beginning of 2.2 where 3 + 5 is defined as incrementing five three times, finally the inductive step, we can add n++ to m by defining (n++) + m to be (n + m)++. 
</p>

<p>
Try writing your own examples as advised in the book <i>How to Think Like a Mathematician</i>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>0 + m = m</li>
<li>1 + m = ((0++) + m) or m++</li>
<li>2 + m = ((1++) + m) or ((m++)++)</li>
<li>3 + m = ((2++) + m) or (((m++)++)++)</li>
<li>4 + m = ((3++) + m) or ((((m++)++)++)++)</li>
<li>2 + 3 = ((3++)++) or (4++) or 5.</li>
<li>3 + 2 = (((2++)++)++) or ((3++)++) or (4++) or 5.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Lemma 2.2.2 notice first how he is using the exact same induction template from 2.1.11, you will eventually get very familiar with this template. He's using prior established definitions to set up the proofs, notably definition 2.2.1 where 0 + m = m is defined. He assumed that n + 0 = n. Next the inductive step, where (n++) + 0 = n++. No arithmetic was done here, he pointed to the definition of addition from 2.2.1 that (n++) + 0 is (n + 0)++ or n++, so we have n++ = n++ and the proof is done. He used a different variable to not confuse it with the previously established definition of 0 + m = m, since we are now going the other way with n + 0 = n on our way to prove a + b = b + a.
</p>


<p>
Lemma 2.2.3 Prove: n + (m++) = (n + m)++. We are inducting on n, and keeping m fixed which means we apply the inductive step to n++ instead of m++. Replace all instances of n with 0 for the base case and show the inductive hypothesis holds that 0 plus the increment of some other number, equals that number. Try picking apart this proof yourself to follow it:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>base case:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>0 + (m++) = (0 + m)++</li>
<li>left side is m++ because of definition 2.2.1</li>
<li>right side is m++ because of definition 2.2.1</li>
</ul></li>
<li>inductive hypotenuse: 'Suppose n + m++ = (n + m)++'</li>
<li>inductive step:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>n++ + (m++) = (n++ + m)++</li>
<li>left side is  ((n + m)++)++ because of 2.2.1</li>
<li>right side is ((n + m)++)++ because of 2.2.1</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Corollary: Tao asks why n++ = n + 1 is a consequence from the two proved lemmas. Compare lemma 2.2.3 <i>For any natural numbers n and m, n + (m++) = (n + m)++</i> to definition 2.2.1 where we were able to show m++ = m + 1. Compare lemma 2.2.2 to the base case in definition 2.2.1
</p>

<p>
Proposition 2.2.4 (Addition is commutative) the base case is straight forward. We use the definition of addition, and lemma 2.2.2 to rewrite the successor of n to be (n + m)++ = (m + n)++ and now it is in the form of the inductive hypothesis, so we can use our hypothesis of n + m = m + n to show that (m + n)++ is the same as (n + m)++. Proposition 2.2.6 is similar.

<p>
Proposition 2.2.5 (Addition is associative) what we want to prove is (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
Obtain the inductive template from the beginning of the chapter and try this yourself, making sure you write out full sentences exactly like Tao does for his proofs. Here is all the scratch work I do before writing a proof:
</p>

<p>
<b>Base Case</b>: What is the base case? We want to show that even if a natural number is inside or outside brackets, it will have the same result when added together. Let's pick c or a, as on each side of the equality they are either inside the bracket, or outside it. This will use substitution, which is in the appendix. If we say x = y, then every occurrence of y we can substitute for x:
</p>

<p>
(a + b) + 0 = a + (b + 0) (substitute 0 for c)
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>left side: (a + b) + 0 since b + 0 = b (lemma 2.2.2) then we have:</li>
<li>a + (b + 0) (lemma 2.2.2)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>base case: a + (b + 0) = a + (b + 0)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>or choose a: right side: 0 + (b + c) = b + c by definition of addition</li>
<li>lef side: (0 + b) + c by definition of addition
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>another base case: 0 + (b + c) = 0 + (b + c)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>IH</b>:
The inductive hypothesis we assume addition is associative, and that (a + b) + c = a + (b + c). If any steps of your proof are either in form (a + b) + c or a + (b + c) you can substitute them for each other by the IH. For example: x + y + a + (b + c). Note a + (b + c) is the form of the IH, so can change this to x + y + (a + b) + c 
</p>

<p>
<b>Inductive step</b>: There's a few ways to show this, I'll move stuff around randomly and you can see where the proof is:
</p>

<p>
(a + b) + (c++) = a + (b + (c++))
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>right side: a + (b + (c++))</li>
<li>a + (b + c)++ (lemma 2.2.3)</li>
<li>((a + b) + c)++ (by the IH)</li>
<li>((a + b)++) + c (def of addition)</li>
<li>((b + a)++) + c (commutative)</li>
<li>((b++)+ a) + c (def of addition)</li>
<li>c + ((b++) + a) (commutative)</li>
<li>c + (a + (b++)) (commutative)</li>
<li>left side: (a + b) + (c++)</li>
<li>(c++) + (a + b) (commutative)</li>
<li>(c + (a + b))++ (def of addition.. consider (a + b) to be one value
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Recall (n++) + m = (n + m)++ ergo (n++) + (m + b) is (n + (m + b))++</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>((a + b) + c)++ (commutative)</li>
<li>(a + (b + c))++ (by the IH)</li>
<li>((b + c) + a)++ (commutative)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>etc., can keep moving these around</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Try moving everything around until you understand exactly how commutativity and associativity work. See if you can get it to a form where you can use the inductive hypothesis, substitute and permute them around some more until this starts to make sense. Remember to think as (n + m) as one value, so (n++) + (n + m) is (n + (n + m))++ and (n + (n + m)) can be rewritten according to commutative property ((n + m) + n).
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The proof, write full sentences: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We induct on <i>a</i> keeping <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> fixed. We first consider the base case a = 0 and we have to prove (0 + b) + c = 0 + (b + c). By the definition of addition (0 + b) + c = b + c, and 0 + (b + c) = b + c, thus both sides are equal to b + c and are equal to each other. Suppose inductively that addition is associative and (a + b) + c = a + (b + c), now we have to prove that ((a++) + b) + c = (a++) + (b + c) to close the induction. By the definition of addition, the left hand side is equal to ((a + b)++) + c which is also equal to ((a + b) + c)++ by the definition of addition. By the inductive hypothesis, ((a + b) + c)++ is equal to (a + (b + c))++. The right-hand side is equal to (a + (b + c))++ by the definition of addition and now both sides are equal to each other, and we have closed the induction.</li>

Proposition 2.2.6 (Cancellation Law) uses Axiom 2.4 which states '<i>Different natural numbers must have different successors; i.e., if n, m are natural numbers and n = m, then n++ = m++. Equivalently, if n++ = m++, then we must have n = m</i>'. So (a + b)++ = (a + c)++ is = a + b = a + c by the line <i>if n++ = m++, then n = m</i> in axiom 2.4. We dropped down from the successor by using axiom 2.4 and can now use our inductive hypothesis of the cancellation law for a to show b = c and close the induction. .

We can also try the chapter on contradiction proofs in Kevin Houston's book or the appendix of <i>Analysis</i>: Suppose for the sake of contradiction that that there exists two different natural numbers with the same successor. Then a = m++ and b = m++. But then by Axiom 2.4 we have a = b, a contradiction.  
</p>

<p>
Definition 2.2.11 n is greater or equal to m if n = m + some other natural number. If that number is 0, then the equality holds, if that number is 0++ then the inequality holds.

Proposition 2.2.12 / Exercise 2.2.3: Prove the basic properties of order for natural numbers. Here I will show how you can 'reverse' a lemma or other proved proposition, none of this is a properly written proof only notes on moving through steps to understand the problem then after write a proof in the style Tao has been teaching us. We just want to point to definitions and lemmas here not use induction:   
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Order is reflexive</b></li>
<li>Reflexive property is that any natural number is equal to itself.</li>
<li>We want to show order is reflexive: a \(\ge\) a</li>
<li>a = a + n (def 2.2.11 of ordering of natural numbers)</li>
<li>From lemma 2.2.2 we know that  a + 0 = a and so a = a and is reflexive</li>
<li>By definition 2.2.11 we also have a \(\ge\) a</li>
<li><b>Transitive order property</b></li>
<li>a \(\ge\) b and b \(\ge\) c, then a \(\ge\) c</li>
<li>If a = b + 0, b = c + 0, and a = c + 0, then we have lemma 2.2.2 and transitivity (equality) holds with a = b, b = c and a = c.</li>
<li>Substitution:</li>
<li>a = b + n</li>
<li>b = c + n
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>b is equal to (c + n) so let's put that in place of b in a = b + n:</li>
</ul></li>
<li>a = (c + n) + n</li>
<li>a = c + (n++)</li>
<li>By lemma 2.2.10 we have a = c + m since b++ will always equal some nonzero natural number. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>By definition 2.2.11 a = c + m is a \(\ge\) c + m</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Proof attempt, though we could write our own def or lemma that a + b = a natural number it's largely implied by everything we've read so far: By the definition of Ordering of the natural numbers, if a = b + m and b = c + n, then a = c + m + n. By associativity a = c + (m + n) and since if a = b when m or n are 0, then a = c when m and n are 0. By substitution d = m + n, and since m and n are natural numbers, d is a natural number by the Peano axioms and 2.1.3 (m + n)++ = d++, and by Axiom 2.4 (m + n) = d so we have a = c + d as desired by the definition of Ordering of the natural numbers. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">

Proposition 2.2.14 (Strong induction) From MIT this <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/video-lectures/lecture-3-strong-induction/">lecture</a> on strong induction, the intuition here is Q(m) if all the dominoes are already knocked down and there's one left standing, then it too will be knocked down where 'weak induction' intuition is P(n) if you knock down one domino, they will all fall. If P(n) is true because P(n++) implies P(n) true, then for all m \(\le\) P(n), Q(m) is true.  
</p>

<p>
First look up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth">vacuous truth</a> or see the appendix on mathematical reasoning where Tao defines it. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Let Q(n) be the property that P(m) is true for all m\(_0\) \(\le\) m &lt; n for n \(\ge\) m\(_0\).</li>
<li>Q(0) is true since: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>m\(_0\) \(\le\) m &lt; 0 is vacuously true as stated by Tao in the exercise hint</li>
<li>2.2.14 proposition of for all n \(\ge\) m\(_0\) is true 0 \(\ge\) 0\(_0\)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Show that Q(n++) is true:</li>
<li>P(m) m\(_0\) \(\le\) m \(\lt\) n \(\lt\) n++ is true (2.2.11)</li>
<li>P(m) m\(_0\) \(\le\) m \(\lt\) n++ is true for all n \(\ge\) m\(_0\)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Try an example. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>P(n) is the property that n + 0 = n</li>
<li>Q(0) is 0 + 0 = 0 and P(0)</li>
<li>Q(1) is 1 + 0 = 1 and P(1), P(0)</li>
<li>Q(2) is 2 + 0 = 2 and P(2), P(1), P(0)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Exercise 2.2.6: Your proof could roughly be 'Suppose P(n++) is true such that all P(m) is true for m \(\le\) n++. Then per Axiom 2.5 P(n) is true, so P(m) is true for all m \(\le\) n' since Tao hinted at 'backwards induction'.

<b>Exercise 2.3.1</b> 
n x m = m x n:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>base case: 0 x m = m x 0</li>
<li>left side: 0 x m = 0 by definition 2.3.1</li>
</ul>

<p>
For the right side, m x 0 = 0, write your own lemma that mimics 2.2.2 but for multiplication, roughly as so:
</p>

<p>
Lemma X: For any natural number n, n x 0 = 0:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>base case: 0 x 0 = 0</li>
<li>IH: n x 0 = 0</li>
<li>Inductive step: (n++) x 0 = 0</li>
<li>(n x 0) + 0 = 0 (def 2.3.1)</li>
<li>Remove the + 0 (lemma 2.2.2)</li>
<li>Now it is in the form of the IH: n x 0 = 0</li>
</ul>

<p>
Lemma Y: m x (n++) is m + (n x m), rewriting Lemma 2.2.3 but for multiplication 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>base case: Our lemma X and def 2.3.1</li>
<li>IH: m x (n++) = m + (n x m)</li>
<li>Inductive step: m x (n++)++ = m + (n++ x m)</li>

<li>Left:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>m + (n++ x m) by IH</li>
<li>m + (n x m) + m by def 2.3.1</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Right:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>m + (n x m) + m by def 2.3.1</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Now we have to prove m x n = n x m 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>base case: def 2.3.1 and lemma X</li>
<li>IH: m x n = n x m</li>
<li>m x n++ = n++ x m</li>
<li>Lemma Y = def 2.3.1</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.3.2</b>
</p>

<p>
The hint is to prove the second statement first, if n and m are both positive, then nm is also positive. You could use Proposition 2.3.6 as a template for this:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If n &gt; 0, and m &gt; 0, then nm &gt; 0</li>
<li>We have nm = 0 + d for some positive d</li>
<li>Since d is positive, n and m must be positive (or else 0 = 0 + d, a contradiction)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Or you could use Lemma 2.2.10, n x m = (b++) x m and then mimic 2.3.6 to determine n x m is positive if n and m are positive. Note that (b++) x m expands to the form (b x m) + b, and since you know a x b + a is the successor form of multiplication it can't be zero. 
</p>

<p>
Lemma 2.3.3: n x m = 0 iff n = 0 or m = 0. You could try a contradiction using the nm &gt; 0 proof we already wrote, so it must be n = 0 or m = 0 if nm = 0 or a contrapositive of Tao's statement: see the appendix on mathematical reasoning or look up contrapositive in Houston's book. If Tao states something, and then proves it, then there is a contrapositive statement we can use to prove another fact.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.3.3</b>
A rewrite of 2.2.5: For any natural numbers a, b c, we have (a x b) x c = a x (b x c). You could induct on b, convert to the 2.3.1 form, and rearrange whenever you move something around and it is in the form of the inductive hypotenuse.
</p>

<p>
Tao also suggests using the distributive law:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Inductive Step: (a x b++) x c = a x (b++ x c)</li>
<li>(a(b++)c) = (a(b++)c) by distributed law</li>
<li>(ac(b++)) = (ac(b++)) by commutative law</li>
<li>(ac(b + 1)) = (ac(b + 1)) by corollary n++ = n + 1</li>
<li>acb + ac = acb + ac by distributed law again
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>cancellation law the two +ac:</li>
<li>acb = acb or (ab)c = a(bc)</li>
<li>or permute any way you want like we did for 2.2.5</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<p>
<b>Exercise 2.3.4</b> 
</p>

<p>
Prove the <a href="https://youtu.be/7eZUzceFFJw">identity</a>.  
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(a + b)(a + b) = (a + b)a + (a + b)b by distributive law/exponentiation</li>
<li>aa + ba + ab + bb by distributive law</li>
<li>a\(^2\) + ba + ab + b\(^2\) by def 2.3.11/Examples 2.3.12</li>
<li>ba + ab is ba + ba by commutative law</li>
<li>ba + ba is 2ba by def 2.3.1 where 2 x m = 0 + m + m</li>
<li>(a + b)\(^2\) = a\(^2\) + 2ab + b\(^2\)</li>
</ul>


<p>
<b>Exercise 2.3.5</b>
</p>

<p>
Prove proposition 2.3.9 by fixing q and inducting on n for n = mq + r and 0 \(\le\) r \(\lt\) q
</p>

<p>
For the base case, if 0 = mq + r, then m and r must be zero because this still satisfies the inequality where q is greater than r and remember we fixed q, so it can't be zero. For the inductive step, n + 1 = mq + r + 1 (adding + 1 to both sides as per previous lectures on induction), we have two cases, r + 1 &lt; q or r + 1 \(\le\) q. If r + 1 &lt; q then we have the inductive hypothesis and there's nothing more to prove since 0 \(\le\) r + 1 \(\lt\) q. Remember the order of multiplication/addition, this is still (number) = (number) plus n in the form of (n + 1) = (mq) + (r + 1). 
</p>

<p>
If r + 1 \(\le\) q, or (r = q), then we have n + 1 = mq + q, and from the definition of multiplication/distributive law this is n + 1 = (m + 1)q or m++(q) + 0 and 0 still satisfies the inequality of r &lt; q.

Wildberger has a unique encoding of polynomials in the rest of his math foundations <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5A714C94D40392AB">playlist</a> by abstracting coefficients into columns and rows. Pascal's array is then used, and things like factoring or polynomial division is surprisingly trivial to do. Later in the same playlist he teaches some algebraic calculus using this polynumber encoding and taking derivatives and doing integration is again trivial arithmetic. They could teach this to primary school kids. If you have time, I highly recommend watching the rest of the playlist.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org27cc84f">
<p>
Before we do trig, let's learn what \(\pi\) is. Wildberger <a href="https://youtu.be/lcIbCZR0HbU">talks</a> about the history of pi such as Archimedes interval for pi, Newton's formula, a hexadecimal version of pi, his own formula. The end of this lecture he claims pi is some kind of complex object we still don't understand. At this stage we only need to know it's a constant, or the applied approximation of 22/7 or 355/113.

<h2 id="org0768b74">Trigonometry Boot Camp</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0768b74">
<p>
Let's take the Brown Univeristy trig <a href="http://www.math.brown.edu/~dkatz/trigbootcamp/">boot camp</a>. There is a crash course <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qvZ8-9IxiI">lecture</a>. I assume you know the basic gist of what an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle">angle</a> is which will be better defined when we take calculus.   
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Radians you could even make up your own notation and define it as dblpi = 6.283… and then 360deg is dblpi, 90deg is 1/4dblpi, 180deg is dblpi/2, etc.</li>
<li>We really only need to know sine and cosine functions, all others are derived from them</li>
<li>In the scaling of triangles example where \(\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\) becomes \(\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}\) they are rationalizing the denominator:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\cdot\frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt 2}\) is \(\frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt 2 \cdot \sqrt 2}\) which is \(\frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt 4}\) or \(\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}\)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can download the <a href="http://www.math.brown.edu/~dkatz/trigbootcamp/trigbootcamp-presentationslides.pdf">slides</a> to keep a copy of the scaled triangles</li>
<li>The reflections think about subtracting 1/6 from 1/1, you get 5/6 so 5pi/6 is pi (180 deg) minus 1pi/6, and a negative direction means we are moving clockwise so move to pi, subtract pi/6 in other direction.</li>
<li>The end of the lecture we finally discover why sin() and cos() are wave functions, since it's a function that moves around the unit circle. Tan() is the slope 'rise over run'</li>
</ul>

<p>
Summary: There exists 3 triangles, which we should know their measurements, and scale them down since this is a unit circle with maximum x and y values of 1. Then we superimpose the triangles in the pi/2 (90deg) angle space on the unit circle in such a way that we have known values of cos()/sin() and other trig functions, because we can derive those other functions from cosine and sine. We reflect these triangles into the other areas of the circle so we can get x/y values there as well by rotating around the circle and then adding up all the angles to indicate how much we rotated counter-clockwise (positive) and clockwise (negative). A reflection is demonstrated <a href="https://youtu.be/aCypVdCNgWE">here</a> so if f(x) = sin(x), cos(x) and tan(x) then y = -(fx). 
</p>

<p>
Try the <a href="http://www.math.brown.edu/~dkatz/trigbootcamp/trigbootcamp-practiceworksheet.pdf">worksheet</a> you can actually draw these out and count rotations if you want or use this radian to angle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)#/media/File:Degree-Radian_Conversion.svg">picture</a> from Wikipedia. The equations if one side is squared, then you need to take the square root of both sides so it's (not-squared = value) instead of (squared thing = value-when-squared). If you're stuck watch the video that walks through all the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQo2SXbasC4">solutions</a> then do the worksheet again until you can finish it without needing to look at the video walkthru. 
</p>

<p>
How I solved these: subtract 1 pi if it's bigger than 2pi, or a 1/2pi if smaller and see what you get, look at the 3 triangles if they have a corresponding value for sin/cos. If not subtract pi/3, pi/6 etc. If you're wondering why we are using radians instead of degrees it is explained <a href="https://youtu.be/CnQXRdgN_7I">here</a>. Wildberger's rational trigonometry uses a turn, so pi/2 is 1/4, pi is 1/2, and 2pi is 1. Angles are replaced by 'the spread of vectors'.

<h3 id="orgff01f24">Some Calculus</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgff01f24">
<p>
Now that we know trig functions, watch this basics of calculus <a href="https://youtu.be/zfHEkt-1sqo">crash course</a> which was designed for non-english speaking students to learn math notation (with Chinese subtitles). Note in the last few examples how the derivative works d = \(nx^{n-1}\) so in the examples the derivative of \(y = \frac{-g}{2}t^2+v_0t+y_0\) is (\(2\cdot\frac{-g}{2}t^{2-1}+ 1\cdot v_0t^{1-1}\)) or \(-gt + v_0\) you take the exponent power, multiply the coefficient of the base, and subtract the power, so the derivative of  \(-gt^1 + v_0\) is (\(1\cdot-gt^0 + v_0\)) which is -g, as we'll see later any terms without a variable (in this example t) cancels out or as Wildberger mentioned are so small so they are discarded.  
</p>

<p>
Summary: if you know the acceleration, then you integrate to find the velocity, then integrate again to find the position. If you know the position, you take a derivative to find it's velocity, and take another derivative to find the acceleration. One function tells you how another function is changing. These are also higher order functions we learned in CS019, where a function produces another function. 
</p>

<p>
Try reading the first chapter from Gilbert Strang's <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/">calculus</a> and see if you understand it. His book was designed for self-learning, so that first chapter assumes little background and builds up this intuition of one function that tells you about another. There is also a <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-005-highlights-of-calculus-spring-2010/highlights_of_calculus/big-picture-of-calculus/">lecture</a> for this chapter and a self-study <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/study-guide/">guide</a> that acts as a recitation.

This chapter on set theory in <i>Analysis I</i> relies on the fact that you've already read the appendix on logic and have an idea what implies means or disjunction. Now that we have done some proofs ourselves, and the basics of trigonometry we can finally understand some of the examples he uses in this appendix. Tao makes a point that this chapter is meant to be read and understood not studied and memorized, and thankfully he is not bombarding us with piles of confusing logic notation that you normally see in other 'how to do proofs' books. At the same time you read this appendix, read <i>How to Think Like a Mathematician</i> by K. Houston it will clear up any cryptic definitions like how implication works.

Proposition A.2.3, confusing the hypotenuse "Suppose that&#x2026;" by assuming the conclusion. We always assume the hypotenuse, and prove the conclusion.  Proposition A.2.6, proof by contradiction, we know that when pi/2 (90deg) the sine function is 1, because remember it is the y axis of the unit circle.

<h3 id="orgc584dc0">3.1 Fundamentals (Set Theory)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc584dc0">
<p>
We are back to reading Tao's <i>Analysis I</i> and still in the realm of the natural numbers. Example 3.1.2 is similar to a nested list such as [list: 1, [list: 1, 2], 100] is length 3, even though there is a nested list overall it still only contains 3 elements. Remark 3.1.3 is in the above historical lectures on set theory. We are referred to Appendix A.7 Equality to read about the substitution axiom which you should have already read.
</p>

<p>
Lemma 3.1.6 if set A is equal to set (empty), then if x is in A it must also be in set empty, a contradiction, so A must be a non-empty set is how I interpret the lemma, which is a way to say that if an empty set exists, there must also be a possibility of a non-empty set. Remark 3.1.8 Cardinality if you watched the Wildberger <i>History of Mathematics</i> <a href="#orgb38ede0">lecture</a> linked above assigns a value.
</p>

<p>
Note the errata for Definition 3.1.4 from Tao's site: "Definition 3.1.4 has to be given the status of an axiom (the axiom of extensionality) rather than a definition, changing all references to this definition accordingly.  This requires some changes to the text discussing this definition. Firstly, in the preceding paragraph, “define the notion of equality” will now be “seek to capture the notion of equality”, and “formalize this as a definition” should be “formalize this as an axiom”.  For the paragraph after Example 3.1.5, delete the first two sentences, and remove the word “Thus” from the third sentence. Exercise 3.1.1 is now trivial and can be deleted." So this is now Axiom 3.1.4, but the definition remains the same. 
</p>

<p>
Exercise 3.1.2 prove emptyset, {emptyset}, {{emptyset}}, and {emptyset{emptyset}} are all not equal.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If \(\emptyset\) = {\(\emptyset\)} then by Def 3.1.4 \(\emptyset\) \(\in \emptyset\) a contradiction to Axiom 3.2</li>
<li>Same reasoning as above for \(\emptyset\) is not equal to {{\(\emptyset\)}} or {\(\emptyset\){\(\emptyset\)}}</li>
<li>{\(\emptyset\)} is not equal to {{\(\emptyset\)}} because [list: 1] is not equal to [list: [list: 1]]. The first has element 1 in it, the second has element [list: 1]. More precisely if {\(\emptyset\)} = {{\(\emptyset\)}} then by Def 3.1.4 every element of {\(\emptyset\)} (it's only element is \(\emptyset\)) must be in {{\(\emptyset\)}} (it's only element is {\(\emptyset\)})  and vice-versa, so claiming {\(\emptyset\)} \(\in\) {\(\emptyset\)} which contradicts Axiom 3.3, where y \(\in\) {a} iff y = a. In this case y must = \(\emptyset\) to be in {\(\emptyset\)}.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Remark 3.1.21 clarifies the above exercise how {2} is not in {1,2,3} but 2 is in {1,2,3}. The rest of this chapter is straight forward definitions of set operations, better than the usual treatment of venn diagrams. Remark 3.1.26 distinct is defined as <i>there are elements of one set which are not elements of the other</i> so \(\emptyset\) and \(\emptyset\) are not distinct because neither can have elements. In Proposition 3.1.28 notice how any operation on two sets results in a new set, like a higher order filter function over a list results in a new list. 
</p>

<p>
Example 3.1.32 looks a lot like programming syntax. There seems to be an order of evaluation, applying the axiom of specification first to create a new set, then applying the axiom of replacement so working right to left in {n++ : n \(\in\) {3,5,9); n&lt;6}

<li>3.1.3 prove the remaining claims in 3.1.13:</li>
<li>If a and b are objects, then {a, b} = {a} U {b}:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>By (new axiom) 3.1.4 we need to show every element x in {a, b} is in {a} U {b}. Suppose that x is an element of {a, b} then by axiom 3.3 x = a or x = b. By Axiom 3.4 this means at least one of the following statements is true: x is in {a} or x is in {b}. We divide into cases. If x is in a, then by axiom 3.4 it is in {a} U {b}, similarly if x is in b, it is also in {a} U {b}. Thus in both cases we see every element of {a, b} is in {a} U {b}.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The next claim, prove the union operation is commutative: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Follows the same proof he did for the union operation is associative. Suppose x is an element of A \(\cup\) B. By def 3.1.4 and axiom 3.4 pairwise union then x \(\in\) A or x \(\in\) B. By disjuntion this is also x \(\in\) B or x \(\in\) A. So x is in B \(\cup\) A and x is in A \(\cup\) B.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Last claim, prove A \(\cup\) A is equal to A \(\cup\) \(\emptyset\) is equal to \(\emptyset\) \(\cup\) A is equal to A. Suppose x is an element in A \(\cup\) A, then x is in A or x is in A, so by disjunction (we can pick either, but there's only one choice) x is in A. If x is in \(\emptyset\) \(\cup\) A, x is in \(\emptyset\) or x is in A, so x is in the union of A and \(\emptyset\) and since the emptyset is empty x is in A.</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>3.1.4 prove claims in Proposition 3.1.18 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You can write both these proofs exactly like his 3.1.18 proof for transitivity. Suppose A \(\subset\) B and B \(\subset\) A. To prove that A = B we have to prove that every element A is an element of B, and every element B is an element of A by def 3.1.4. Let us pick an arbitrary element x \(\in\) A. Then, since A \(\subset\) B, x must also be an element of B. But since B \(\subset\) A, then every element of A is an element of B and every element B is an element of A. By 3.1.4 they are equal.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>3.1.15 Show how union, intersection and subset are logically equivalent:</li>
<li>Look in the <a href="#org66f6695">Houston</a> book in the appendix, see the advice for how to prove that two statements are equivalent. For this exercise if A is a subset of B, and the union of A and B = B, then this implies the intersection of A and B will be A, which in turn implies A is a subset of B. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We will show that any two set operations implies another. If x is in A \(\cup\) B, then by definition of union x is in A or B, so by disjunction x is in B. If x is in A, since A is a subset of B then x is again in B. Thus x \(\in\) A \(\cup\) B if and only if x \(\in\) B and by definition of union, and axiom of equality 3.1.4, A \(\cup\) B = B. Since x is in B, if x is in A \(\cap\) B it must also be in A, so x is in A and B, which is the definition of intersection, and if A \(\cap\) B = A, and if A \(\cup\) B = B, then every element of A is in B so A \(\subset\) B.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>3.1.16 Prove proposition 3.1.28
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>de Morgan's laws a proof exists for them everywhere including youtube.</li>
<li>Rough proof strategy: what you want to do is get your arbitrary element into the form of the definitions for union, intersection and difference sets.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>3.1.8 You can google the absorption laws (disjunction(OR) absorbs conjuction(AND)) then try your own proof</li>
<li>3.1.9 If A intersection B = emptyset, then they are disjoint (have no elements in common). This is the definition of 3.1.27 difference of sets, where x is in A but not in B, so A = x - b and B = x - a if the union of A and B = X.</li>
<li>3.1.10 All I can think of is the emptyset, since emptyset union emptyset is still emptyset, and emptyset intersection emptyset is also disjoint.</li>
<li>3.1.11 There is a solution <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2107214/show-that-axiom-of-replacement-implies-from-the-axiom-of-specification-proof-ve">here</a>, but suppose we have a statement P(x, y) pertaining to x and y such that for each x in A, there is at most one y for which P(x, y) is true. Then by the axiom of replacement there exists a set {y: y = f(x) for some x in A}, then y = f(x) for some x in A, and y is in the set of A precisely when P(x) is true, which is the definition of the axiom of specification. Not a complete proof but something like that is the strategy.</li>

3.3.14 See this <a href="https://youtu.be/DP1ND5-w7fg">tutorial</a>. Write your own examples for this definition. If two distinct elements of A map to the same element of B, this is not injective. However if those two elements are equal to each other then it is injective: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A = {a, b, a}</li>
<li>B = {1, 2}
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>f(a) = 1</li>
<li>f(b) = 2</li>
<li>f(a) = 1 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>but f(a) = f(a), so a = a and this function is injective.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>f(a) = 1</li>
<li>f(b) = 1</li>
<li>f(a) = 1
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>but f(a) doesn't equal f(b) so this not injective</li>

A all of these proofs have a youtube tutorial or stackexchange answer, these are common proofs first year students do.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ex 3.3.1 was deleted in errata (See Tao's site)</li>
<li>Ex 3.3.2 The proof for this is in the book <a href="https://infinitedescent.xyz/">https://infinitedescent.xyz/</a>.</li>
<li>Ex 3.3.3 The empty function is always injective since it's 'vacuously true' that f(x) = f(x'). It is never surjective since there are no elements in the emptyset that fit the surjective definition of every element in Y is a value of f(x) of f(x) = y, and thus never bijective, since a function must be both injective and surjective to be bijective.</li>
<li>Ex 3.3.4 The tilde hat thinghy is just notation for two different fuctions, like f and f'. Cancellation law means we're trying to prove two different functions are the same so g = g' and f = f'. If f and g are injective, then g(f(x)) = g(f'(x)) and f(x) = f'(x), and by one-to-one definition of injective functions f = f' (since f is g's input).  Surjective is similar, g(y) = g'f(x)) = g(f(x)) = g'(y) so g = g'. Does g need to be injective for this proof to always hold? Try corner case examples from the text, like if g = n<sup>2</sup>, then g(f(-1)) and g(f'(1)) have the same output, so two different inputs to g with same output means f(x) can't equal f(x') as per definition of one-to-one functions so we can't always derive f = f'.</li>
<li>Ex 3.3.5 If f is injective in g(f(x)), then g doesn't need to be injective. Consider an example A = {1}, B = {2, 3}, and C = {4}. f(1) = g(2) = 4 so f is still injective. The difference in 3.3.4 is the wording 'show that these two input functions are always equal if g in injective' and the second question 'Is this still true if g is not injective?' which means a single case where if g is not injective, and we get two non distinct inputs that equal the same outputg, the whole proof is false whereas here we are asked 'must g always be injective' so just needa single case of not needing to be injective.</li>
<li>Ex 3.3.6 Is described <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2865322">here</a> see Remark 3.3.24 if you forgot what an inverse function is. Note how the inverse of f and f cancel each other out.</li>
<li>Ex 3.3.7 Similar to above and his association proof</li>

Watch <a href="https://youtu.be/K0CoGGcLc1M?t=2161">this</a> starting @ 36:00, from 41:00+ he shows how he solves problems step by step, trying small cases to understand the problem better and poking at the problem enough to finally figure out a proof. 
</p>

<p>
Reminder that a proof is a convincing argument to ourselves written in full sentences. There is no right or wrong proof at this stage, we are practicing this skill at first to help ourselves understand these definitions and how to apply them, and as we go you will see more and more different proofs by different authors which builds more skill until eventually you pick it up. You can always check your own proofs too, going through Tao's mathematical logic appendix and seeing if the opposite of your argument holds, and double checking all your assumptions 'is there a definition of X or did I just assume it existed'. 
</p>

<p>
So tl;dr relax and just keep writing because the practice of flipping back through the text and rereading definitions and theorems, tracing the logic and seeing how one definition helps define another, and putting this in the form of notes (a proof) is how you learn. This is why none of these books contain solutions because you're supposed to figure it out yourself and if you look at the answer, then you didn't do all the above and you won't learn anything.

Chapter 3.4 of Tao's <i>Analysis I</i>. Example 3.4.5 makes more sense if you read Example 3.4.6 too, f<sup>-1</sup>({0,1,4}) is the set of everything that could result in {0,1,4} if f(x) = 2x, so {-2,-1,0,1,2} and in Example 3.4.5, the set of everything in the natural numbers that can result in {1,2,3} if f(x) = 2x, is only f({1}). Axiom 3.11 (Union) if A = {{2,3}, {3,4}, {4,5}} and Ua = {2,3,4,5} why? Because it's {2,3} U {3,4} U {4, 5} you are performing union on every set.

We're doing <i>Analysis I</i> and Linear Algebra in parallel. These sets of lectures cover Linear Algebra from a geometric approach so when we work through Tao's Linear Algebra <a href="https://terrytao.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/linear-algebra-notes.pdf">notes</a> we can understand what is happening. The foundations of this geometry are simple and from Pappus of Alexandria's law of parallel lines.

<p>
Welcome to 320 AD in ancient Alexandria you're learning linear algebra with just parallel lines. Around 4000 years ago, the people of Babylon knew how to solve a simple 2x2 system of linear equations with two unknowns and around 200 BC the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nine_Chapters_on_the_Mathematical_Art">book</a> <i>Nine Chapters of the Mathematical Art</i> displayed how to solve a 3x3 system of equations so linear algebra in some form or another has been around a very long time. 
</p>

<p>
He constructs the affine plane from scratch. The vector (8/3, 10,3) you need to full screen to better see exactly where they are. From B, you move right 2 lines, and 2/3 so \(2 + \frac{2}{3}\) which is 8/3. From there you move up 1/3, and 3 so \(3 + \frac{1}{3}\) which is 10/3. Reasons for using the affine plane are you do not impose anything on it artificially like the origin (0,0) in the Cartesian plane, you can do projections easily, and it's construction is simple, since only parallel lines. 
</p>

<p>
The biggest a takeaway here is what vector direction is, what a basis vector is and how you can combine them to form larger vectors, and how to translate basis vectors to suit different perspectives. The exercises at the end the delta symbol will return in the lecture on area and the determinant. 
</p>

<p>
In this optional related <a href="https://youtu.be/Nu-YPJSNFpE">lecture</a> he shows how ancient people made a ruler using just parallel line geometry, which leads to modelling the rational continuum.

All this vector arithmetic will come up later in other courses, at least now you will be somewhat familiar with it. The proof for diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, note how quickly this can become a pile of symbols.
