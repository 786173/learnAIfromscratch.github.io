This is a (ongoing) workshop to learn the math needed for various prereqs in university AI intro courses, and is Part IB of the <a href="https://learnaifromscratch.github.io">AI Tripos</a>. No background is assumed. We start by writing proofs of basic arithmetic with the natural numbers and work our way up. Proof writing is a skill you practice like every other skill, if you persist and practice it enough eventually you pick up the skill. If you want a proven strategy how to schedule this workload watch <a href="https://youtu.be/YFUIPg8P2sY?t=278">this</a> starting at time index 4:38 - 6:25 <i>Do 1% effort for 100 days</i>. I watch a lecture one day, next day try some exercises, next day read a chapter, mainly 1 - 2 hrs a day sometimes less or more on the weekends but I try and do it everyday because it's a good habit to build, and then you won't forget things and have to redo them.

An interesting explanation of multiplication.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Laws for addition
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>n + m = m + n (Commutative)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Changing the order of the elements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(k + n) + m = k + (m + n) (Associative)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Changing the grouping of the elements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>n + 1 = s(n) (Successor)</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Laws for multiplication
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>nm = mn (Commutative)</li>
<li>(kn)m = k(nm) (Associative)</li>
<li>n \(\cdot\) 1 = n (Identity)</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Note the different notation for multiplication:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>nm</li>
<li>n \(\cdot\) m</li>
<li>n \(\times\) m</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Distributive laws
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>k(n + m) = kn + km</li>
<li>(k + n)m = km + nm</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<p>
Exercise: Prove why the multiplication and distributive laws work. Since we have no idea what a proof is yet, we can instead try going through some of our own examples.   
</p>

<p>
Identity law: n \(\cdot\) 1 = n.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We are creating n groups of 1. According to our definition of multiplication |||| \(\cdot\) | would be 4 groups of | or ||||. This is still 4.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Commutative law: nm = mn. 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>||| \(\cdot\) || = || || || or 6. Rearranging this, || \(\cdot\) ||| is ||| ||| which is again 6.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Associative law: (kn)m = k(nm).  
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If k = |, and n = ||, and m = ||| and parens expressions are evaluated first:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Left side: (kn)m. We first evaluate (kn) as || (2 groups of 1, the identity law), and 2m is ||| ||| (2 groups of 3) for a total of 6.</li>
<li>Right side: k(nm): In the parens nm is 2 groups of 3, so ||| |||.  k(6) is the identity law, one group of 6. Thus (kn)m = k(nm).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Distributive law: (k + n)m = km + nm.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If k = ||||, and n = ||, and m = |:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Left side: (|||| + ||) is 6, and (6) x 1 is six groups of 1 or 6 according to the identity law.</li>
<li>Right side: km + nm: 4 groups of one is 4, plus two groups of 1 is 2 (identity law). Answer is again 6.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="org02801f8">Subtraction and division</h3>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/mVd202X-2uM">YouTube</a> - Arithmetic and Geometry Math Foundations 4</li>
</ul>

<p>
Subtraction is the inverse of addition
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If k + m = n then k = n - m</li>
<li>Note: n - m is only defined if n &gt; m as we are still in the realm of the Naturals and negative numbers/integers aren't yet defined.</li>
</ul>

<p>
+, -, are binary operations and can only do 2 operations at a time
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Laws of Subtraction:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>n - (m + k) = (n - m) - k</li>
<li>n + (m - k) = (n + m) - k</li>
<li>n - (m - k) = (n - m) + k</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Distributive laws of subtraction:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>n(m - k) = nm - nk</li>
<li>(n - m)k = nk - mk</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Note to remove parens: <a href="https://www.themathpage.com/alg/parentheses.htm">https://www.themathpage.com/alg/parentheses.htm</a> we can drop the grouping enforcement when using addition (associative law) but must distribute the negative sign, as subtraction is not associative.  
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>n - (m + k) = (n - m) - k
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>removing grouping: n - m - k = n - m - k</li>
</ul></li>

We're still in the natural numbers, which he defined as beginning with 1 so we aren't working with zeros yet (no division by zero corner cases). He defines the operations of addition and multiplication with fractions using the laws of division we already learned. 
</p>

<p>
Note how he sets up the proof. The 'prime' notation (the tick, so c', a', b') represents another variable. You could rewrite this 'Suppose a/b = y/z so that a/z = b/y, and c/d = something/another, so that c/another = something/d does it then follow &#x2026;'. 
</p>

<p>
What we are trying to prove is ab' = ba' and cd' = dc'. He introduces some extra notation, multiplying both sides by (dd') to help do this.

Read a little of the introduction like how you can't blindly cancel c from both sides of ac = bc if c = 0, because then the equality makes no sense, you're dividing by zero to remove c from ac = bc. The rest of the examples in the intro we can't figure out yet since we haven't started calculus. Skip to chapter 2. I'm using the Springer 2016 3rd edition.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The five Axioms
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Axiom 2.1: 0 is a natural number</li>
<li>Axiom 2.2: If n is a natural number, then n++ is also a natural number</li>
<li>Axiom 2.3: 0 is not the successor of any natural number</li>
<li>Axiom 2.4: Different natural numbers must have different successors</li>
<li>Axiom 2.5: Let P(n) be any property pertaining to a natural number n. Suppose that P(0) is true, and suppose that whenever P(n) is true, P(n++) is also true. Then P(n) is true for every natural number n. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We make an assumption about a property P(n) being true meaning you do not prove P(n), you prove P(0) and P(n + 1) are true, and both these form a logical implication meaning that if they are both true, then your initial assumption of P(n) being true holds.</li>

Remark 2.1.10 and the template in Proposition 2.1.11 is probably the clearest definition of proof by induction I've seen. Note the example where no natural number can be 'a half number', because of the increment step n + 1. The base case of 0 (as per Axiom 2.5, and Axiom 2.1) fails if we are using 'half numbers' instead of natural numbers because if zero is a natural number, and any n++ is another natural number, the only next successive number is 1 it can't be 0.5 or -3 or 3/4. The way you should view these axioms about the natural numbers is:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>0 is an element of N</li>
<li>if x is an element of N, then so is x + 1.</li>
<li>nothing else is an element of N</li>

Proposition 2.1.16 (Recursive definitions) in the book <i>Analysis I</i>. Tao uses a function but it's definition can be read in the 3.3 functions intro. What is \(a_0\)? It's an index. Imagine a finite sequence: 1, 2, 3. Imagine indexing them: \(1_0\), \(2_1\), \(3_2\) so you can refer to each entry by it's index instead of it's value. (What's a finite <a href="https://youtu.be/LCvk0Qolt68">sequence?</a>)   
</p>

<p>
This proposition is using a new function (a rule that maps from one input to one output) every time, I'm guessing to avoid sequences where they could repeat ie 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 
</p>

<p>
Let's do an example. 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(a_0\) becomes 0 (for c = 0)</li>
<li>\(a_{0++}\) becomes \(f_1(a_1)\) or 1</li>
<li>\(a_{1++}\) becomes \(f_2(a_2)\) or 2</li>
</ul>

<p>
The proof notes Axiom 2.3 protects the value \(a_0\) from being redefined by one of the functions. His base case for this proof is \({a_0}\) (Axiom 2.3) and he is assuming P(n) which is that the procedure will always give a single value to \({a_n}\). Axiom 2.4 is the inductive step, that this procedure will also give a single value to \(a_{m++}\). All of the Axioms are used to prove this.

<h4 id="org49db5bb">Aside: Induction and Recursion</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org49db5bb">
<p>
Induction and recursion are the same concept.  As an example, the specification of a program function twoExp(n) that when given a value n, returns \(2^n\). The examples you write for this program are as follows:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>twoExp(0) = 1</li>
<li>twoExp(1) = 2</li>
<li>twoExp(2) = 4</li>
<li>twoExp(3) = 8</li>
<li>twoExp(4) = 16</li>
<li>twoExp(5) = 32</li>
</ul>

<p>
You notice the pattern: the result of the next value, is 2x the previous value. twoExp(5) is 2 * twoExp(4). You write an algorithm using the above examples: if input = 0, then return 1, otherwise return 2 * twoExp(n-1). You make an assumption, that the input will always be non-negative. Walking through the program execution, twoExp(3) evaluates:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>2 * twoExp(3-1)</li>
<li>2 * (2 * twoExp(2-1))</li>
<li>2 * (2 * (2 * twoExp(1-1)))</li>
<li>2 * (2 * (2 * (1))) = \(2^3\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
To prove this by induction on n, we try the base case P(0). If n = 0 then twoExp(0) evaluates to 1, which is \(2^0\). What is P(n)? According to our recursive definition, n = 2*P where the value of P = twoExp(n-1) or \(2^{n-1}\). Our inductive step is n, since our algorithm is inductively defined n-1, and we wish to prove the successor n + 1, which is n. 2*P = \(2*2^{n-1}\) or \(2^n\). 
</p>

<p>
Note that we didn't have to do anything extra to prove this recursive function. That's because an inductive proof is a recursive function, and a recursive function is an inductive proof.

<p>
Let's understand his example for addition. 3 + 5 should be the same as (((5++)++)++) and adding 0 to 5 should result in 5.  
</p>


<p>
Definition 2.2.1 notice he has a base case (0 + m is m), the hypotenuse "Suppose we inductively defined how to add n to m" which we saw at the beginning of 2.2 where 3 + 5 is defined as incrementing five three times, finally the inductive step, we can add n++ to m by defining (n++) + m to be (n + m)++. 
</p>

<p>
Try writing your own examples
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>0 + m = m</li>
<li>1 + m = ((0++) + m) or m++</li>
<li>2 + m = ((1++) + m) or ((m++)++)</li>
<li>3 + m = ((2++) + m) or (((m++)++)++)</li>
<li>4 + m = ((3++) + m) or ((((m++)++)++)++)</li>
<li>2 + 3 = ((3++)++) or (4++) or 5.</li>
<li>3 + 2 = (((2++)++)++) or ((3++)++) or (4++) or 5.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Lemma 2.2.2 notice first how he is using the exact same induction template from 2.1.11, you will eventually get very familiar with this template. He's using prior established definitions to set up the proofs, notably definition 2.2.1 where 0 + m = m is defined. He assumed that n + 0 = n. Next the inductive step, where (n++) + 0 = n++. No arithmetic was done here, he pointed to the definition of addition from 2.2.1 that (n++) + 0 is (n + 0)++ or n++, so we have n++ = n++ and the proof is done. 
</p>

<p>
He used a different variable to not confuse it with the previously established definition of 0 + m = m, since we are now going the other way with n + 0 = n on our way to prove a + b = b + a.
</p>


<p>
Lemma 2.2.3 Prove: n + (m++) = (n + m)++. We are inducting on n, and keeping m fixed which means we apply the inductive step to n++ instead of m++. Replace all instances of n with 0 for the base case and show the inductive hypothesis holds that 0 plus the increment of some other number, equals that number. Try writing this proof yourself to follow it:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>base case:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>0 + (m++) = (0 + m)++</li>
<li>left side is m++ because of definition 2.2.1</li>
<li>right side is m++ because of definition 2.2.1</li>
</ul></li>
<li>inductive hypotenuse: n + m++ = (n + m)++</li>
<li>inductive step:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>n++ + (m++) = (n++ + m)++</li>
<li>left side is  ((n + m)++)++ because of 2.2.1</li>
<li>right side is ((n + m)++)++ because of 2.2.1</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Corollary:
Tao asks why n++ = n + 1 is a consequence from the two proved lemmas. Compare lemma 2.2.3 <i>For any natural numbers n and m, n + (m++) = (n + m)++</i> to definition 2.2.1 where we were able to show m++ = m + 1. Compare lemma 2.2.2 to the base case in definition 2.2.1
</p>

<p>
Proposition 2.2.4 (Addition is commutative) the base case is straight forward. We use the definition of addition, and lemma 2.2.2 to rewrite the successor of n to be (n + m)++ = (m + n)++ and now it is in the form of the inductive hypothesis, so we can use our hypothesis of n + m = m + n to show that (m + n)++ is the same as (n + m)++. Proposition 2.2.6 is similar.

Proposition 2.2.5 (Addition is associative) what we want to prove is (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
Obtain the inductive template from the beginning of the chapter and try this yourself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Base Case</b>: What is the base case? We want to show that even if a natural number is inside or outside brackets, it will have the same result when added together. Let's pick c or a, as on each side of the equality they are either inside the bracket, or outside it. This will use substitution, which is in the appendix. If we say x = y, then every occurrence of y we can substitute for x:
</p>

<p>
(a + b) + 0 = a + (b + 0) (substitute 0 for c)
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>choose left side: (a + b) + 0</li>
<li>since b + 0 = b (lemma 2.2.2) then we have:</li>
<li>a + (b + 0) (lemma 2.2.2)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>base case: a + (b + 0) = a + (b + 0)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>or choose right side: a + (b + 0)</li>
<li>since b + 0 = b (lemma 2.2.2) then we have:</li>
<li>(a + b) + 0 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>another base case: (a + b) + 0 = (a + b) + 0</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>IH</b>:
The inductive hypothesis we assume addition is associative, and that (a + b) + c = a + (b + c). If any steps of your proof are either in form (a + b) + c or a + (b + c) you can substitute them for each other by the IH. For example: x + y + a + (b + c). Note a + (b + c) is the form of the IH, so can change this to x + y + (a + b) + c 
</p>

<p>
<b>Inductive step</b>: There's a few ways to show this, I'll move stuff around randomly and you can see where the proof is:
</p>

<p>
(a + b) + (c++) = a + (b + (c++))
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>right side: a + (b + (c++))</li>
<li>a + (b + c)++ (lemma 2.2.3)</li>
<li>((a + b) + c)++ (by the IH)</li>
<li>((a + b)++) + c (def of addition)</li>
<li>((b + a)++) + c (commutative)</li>
<li>((b++)+ a) + c (def of addition)</li>
<li>c + ((b++) + a) (commutative)</li>
<li>c + (a + (b++)) (commutative)</li>
<li>left side: (a + b) + (c++)</li>
<li>(c++) + (a + b) (commutative)</li>
<li>(c + (a + b))++ (def of addition.. consider (a + b) to be one value
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Recall (n++) + m = (n + m)++ ergo (n++) + (m + b) is (n + (m + b))++</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>((a + b) + c)++ (commutative)</li>
<li>(a + (b + c))++ (by the IH)</li>
<li>((b + c) + a)++ (commutative)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>etc., can keep moving these around</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Try moving everything around until you understand exactly how commutativity and associativity work. See if you can get it to a form where you can use the inductive hypothesis, substitute and permute them around some more until this starts to make sense. Remember to think as (n + m) as one value, so (n++) + (n + m) is (n + (n + m))++ and (n + (n + m)) can be rewritten according to commutative property ((n + m) + n).

Proposition 2.2.6 (Cancellation Law) uses Axiom 2.4 which states '<i>Different natural numbers must have different successors; i.e., if n, m are natural numbers and n = m, then n++ = m++. Equivalently, if n++ = m++, then we must have n = m</i>'. So (a + b)++ = (a + c)++ is = a + b = a + c by the line <i>if n++ = m++, then n = m</i> in axiom 2.4. We dropped down from the successor by using axiom 2.4 and can now use our inductive hypothesis of the cancellation law for a to show b = c and close the induction. . 
</p>

<p>
Lemma 2.2.10 has an exercise where induction is suggested. For the base case it's clear we can't use a, since (b++) = 0 would violate Axiom 2.3 that zero is not the successor of any natural number. So it must be b, (0++) = a, which by the definition of addition tells us (0++) = 1, which confirms our base case test that 'there exists exactly one natural number who's successor is a' since if a is 1, it can only be (0)++. This is already true by Axiom 2.4 where different natural numbers have different successors, and if you induct on b then you'll end up with the definition of addition (b++)++ = a.

<ul class="org-ul">

</ul>

<p>
a &gt; b then a++ &gt; b 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">

Proposition 2.2.14 (Strong induction) From MIT this <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/video-lectures/lecture-3-strong-induction/">lecture</a> on strong induction, the intuition here is Q(m) if all the dominoes are already knocked down and there's one left standing, then it too will be knocked down where 'weak induction' intuition is P(n) if you knock down one domino, they will all fall. If P(n) is true because P(n++) implies P(n) true, then for all m \(\le\) P(n), Q(m) is true.  
</p>

<p>
First look up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth">vacuous truth</a> or see the appendix on mathematical reasoning where Tao defines it. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Let Q(n) be the property that P(m) is true for all m\(_0\) \(\le\) m &lt; n for n \(\ge\) m\(_0\).</li>
<li>Q(0) is true since: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>m\(_0\) \(\le\) m &lt; 0 is vacuously true as stated by Tao in the exercise hint</li>
<li>2.2.14 proposition of for all n \(\ge\) m\(_0\) is true 0 \(\ge\) 0\(_0\)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Show that Q(n++) is true:</li>
<li>P(m) m\(_0\) \(\le\) m \(\lt\) n \(\lt\) n++ is true (2.2.11)</li>
<li>P(m) m\(_0\) \(\le\) m \(\lt\) n++ is true for all n \(\ge\) m\(_0\)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Try an example. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>P(n) is the property that n + 0 = n</li>
<li>Q(0) is 0 + 0 = 0 and P(0)</li>
<li>Q(1) is 1 + 0 = 1 and P(1), P(0)</li>
<li>Q(2) is 2 + 0 = 2 and P(2), P(1), P(0)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Exercise 2.2.6: Your proof could roughly be 'Suppose P(n++) is true such that all P(m) is true for m \(\le\) n++. Then per Axiom 2.5 P(n) is true, so P(m) is true for all m \(\le\) n' since Tao hinted at 'backwards induction'.

For the right side, m x 0 = 0, write your own lemma that mimics 2.2.2 but for multiplication, roughly as so:

<li>Remove the + 0 (lemma 2.2.2)</li>
<li>Now it is in the form of the IH: n x 0 = 0</li>
</ul>

<p>
Lemma Y: m x (n++) is m + (n x m), rewriting Lemma 2.2.3 but for multiplication 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li>IH: m x (n++) = m + (n x m)</li>
<li>Inductive step: m x (n++)++ = m + (n++ x m)</li>

<li>Left:
<ul class="org-ul">

<h3 id="org59069f1">Exercise 2.3.2</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org59069f1">
<p>
The hint is to prove the second statement first, if n and m are both positive, then nm is also positive. You could use Proposition 2.3.6 as a template for this:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If n &gt; 0, and m &gt; 0, then nm &gt; 0</li>
<li>We have nm = 0 + d for some positive d</li>
<li>Since d is positive, n and m must be positive (or else 0 = 0 + d, a contradiction)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Or you could use Lemma 2.2.10, n x m = (b++) x m and then mimic 2.3.6 to determine n x m is positive if n and m are positive. Note that (b++) x m expands to the form (b x m) + b, and since you know a x b + a is the successor form of multiplication it can't be zero. 
</p>

<p>
Lemma 2.3.3: n x m = 0 iff n = 0 or m = 0. You could try a contradiction using the nm &gt; 0 proof we already wrote, so it must be n = 0 or m = 0 if nm = 0 or a contrapositive of Tao's statement: if n x m is not positive, then nm = 0. See the appendix on mathematical reasoning. If Tao states something, and then proves it, then there is a contrapositive statement we can use to prove another fact. 'If x then y, then if not y, it can't be x'.

<p>
Prove proposition 2.3.9 by fixing q and inducting on n for n = mq + r and 0 \(\le\) r \(\lt\) q
</p>

<p>
For the base case, if 0 = mq + r, then m and r must be zero because this still satisfies the inequality where q is greater than r and remember we fixed q, so it can't be zero. For the inductive step, n + 1 = mq + r + 1 (adding + 1 to both sides as per previous lectures on induction), we have two cases, r + 1 &lt; q or r + 1 \(\le\) q. If r + 1 &lt; q then we have the inductive hypothesis and there's nothing more to prove since 0 \(\le\) r + 1 \(\lt\) q. Remember the order of multiplication/addition, this is still (number) = (number) plus n in the form of (n + 1) = (mq) + (r + 1). 
</p>

<p>
If r + 1 \(\le\) q, or (r = q), then we have n + 1 = mq + q, and from the definition of multiplication/distributive law this is n + 1 = (m + 1)q or m++(q) + 0 and 0 still satisfies the inequality of r &lt; q.

Later in the same playlist he teaches some algebraic calculus using this polynumber encoding and taking derivatives and doing integration is again trivial arithmetic. They could teach this to primary school kids. If you have time, I highly recommend watching the rest of the playlist.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3cf3601">
<p>
Before we do trig, let's learn what \(\pi\) is. Wildberger <a href="https://youtu.be/lcIbCZR0HbU">talks</a> about the history of pi such as Archimedes interval for pi, Newton's formula, a hexadecimal version of pi, his own formula. The end of this lecture he claims pi is some kind of complex object we still don't understand. At this stage we only need to know it's a constant, or the applied approximation of 22/7 or 355/113.

<h2 id="org6e77c77">Trigonometry Boot Camp</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6e77c77">
<p>
Let's take the Brown Univeristy trig <a href="http://www.math.brown.edu/~dkatz/trigbootcamp/">boot camp</a>. There is a crash course <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qvZ8-9IxiI">lecture</a>. I assume you know the basic gist of what an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle">angle</a> is which will be better defined when we take calculus.   
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Radians you could even make up your own notation and define it as dblpi = 6.283… and then 360deg is dblpi, 90deg is 1/4dblpi, 180deg is dblpi/2, etc.</li>
<li>We really only need to know sine and cosine functions, all others are derived from them</li>
<li>In the scaling of triangles example where \(\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\) becomes \(\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}\) they are rationalizing the denominator:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\cdot\frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt 2}\) is \(\frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt 2 \cdot \sqrt 2}\) which is \(\frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt 4}\) or \(\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}\)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can download the <a href="http://www.math.brown.edu/~dkatz/trigbootcamp/trigbootcamp-presentationslides.pdf">slides</a> to keep a copy of the scaled triangles</li>
<li>The reflections think about subtracting 1/6 from 1/1, you get 5/6 so 5pi/6 is pi (180 deg) minus 1pi/6, and a negative direction means we are moving clockwise so move to pi, subtract pi/6 in other direction.</li>
<li>The end of the lecture we finally discover why sin() and cos() are wave functions, since it's a function that moves around the unit circle. Tan() is the slope 'rise over run'</li>
</ul>

<p>
Summary: There exists 3 triangles, which we should know their measurements, and scale them down since this is a unit circle with maximum x and y values of 1. Then we superimpose the triangles in the pi/2 (90deg) angle space on the unit circle in such a way that we have known values of cos()/sin() and other trig functions, because we can derive those other functions from cosine and sine. We reflect these triangles into the other areas of the circle so we can get x/y values there as well by rotating around the circle and then adding up all the angles to indicate how much we rotated counter-clockwise (positive) and clockwise (negative). A reflection is demonstrated <a href="https://youtu.be/aCypVdCNgWE">here</a> so if f(x) = sin(x), cos(x) and tan(x) then y = -(fx). 
</p>

<p>
Try the <a href="http://www.math.brown.edu/~dkatz/trigbootcamp/trigbootcamp-practiceworksheet.pdf">worksheet</a> you can actually draw these out and count rotations if you want or use this radian to angle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)#/media/File:Degree-Radian_Conversion.svg">picture</a> from Wikipedia. The equations if one side is squared, then you need to take the square root of both sides so it's (not-squared = value) instead of (squared thing = value-when-squared). If you're stuck watch the video that walks through all the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQo2SXbasC4">solutions</a> then do the worksheet again until you can finish it without needing to look at the video walkthru. 
</p>

<p>
How I solved these: subtract 1 pi if it's bigger than 2pi, or a 1/2pi if smaller and see what you get, look at the 3 triangles if they have a corresponding value for sin/cos. If not subtract pi/3, pi/6 etc. If you're wondering why we are using radians instead of degrees it is explained <a href="https://youtu.be/CnQXRdgN_7I">here</a>. Wildberger's rational trigonometry uses a turn, so pi/2 is 1/4, pi is 1/2, and 2pi is 1. Angles are replaced by 'the spread of vectors'.

<h3 id="orgf1ebf20">Some Calculus</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf1ebf20">
<p>
Now that we know trig functions, watch this basics of calculus <a href="https://youtu.be/zfHEkt-1sqo">crash course</a> which was designed for non-english speaking students to learn math notation (with Chinese subtitles). Note in the last few examples how the derivative works d = \(nx^{n-1}\) so in the examples the derivative of \(y = \frac{-g}{2}t^2+v_0t+y_0\) is (\(2\cdot\frac{-g}{2}t^{2-1}+ 1\cdot v_0t^{1-1}\)) or \(-gt + v_0\) you take the exponent power, multiply the coefficient of the base, and subtract the power, so the derivative of  \(-gt^1 + v_0\) is (\(1\cdot-gt^0 + v_0\)) which is -g, as we'll see later any terms without a variable (in this example t) cancels out or as Wildberger mentioned are so small so they are discarded.  
</p>

<p>
Summary: if you know the acceleration, then you integrate to find the velocity, then integrate again to find the position. If you know the position, you take a derivative to find it's velocity, and take another derivative to find the acceleration. One function tells you how another function is changing. These are also higher order functions we learned in CS019, where a function produces another function. 
</p>

<p>
Try reading the first chapter from Gilbert Strang's <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/">calculus</a> and see if you understand it. His book was designed for self-learning, so that first chapter assumes little background and builds up this intuition of one function that tells you about another. There is also a <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-005-highlights-of-calculus-spring-2010/highlights_of_calculus/big-picture-of-calculus/">lecture</a> for this chapter and a self-study <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/study-guide/">guide</a> that acts as a recitation.

<p>
This chapter on set theory in <i>Analysis I</i> relies on the fact that you've already read the appendix on logic and have an idea what implies means or disjunction. Now that we have done some proofs ourselves, and the basics of trigonometry we can finally understand some of the examples he uses in this appendix. Tao makes a point that this chapter is meant to be read and understood not studied and memorized, and thankfully he is not bombarding us with piles of confusing logic notation that you normally see in other 'how to do proofs' books. You will probably have to reread parts of this chapter numerous times as you work your way through the rest of the book.
</p>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A.1.1  This is exclusive or, it's negation reading left to right should be 'X is not true and Y is not true OR X and Y are both true'. Let's confirm this by <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2930569/negation-of-exclusive-or">googling</a> and we see we are correct.</li>
<li>A.1.2 The negation is exclusive or, as we showed in A.1.1. This statement reads 'X is not true or Y is not true, but not both'.</li>
<li>A.1.3 Look back at his examples for x iff y and plug in some corner cases. If x = 3, then x*x = 9, so if x doesn't = 3, then x*x=9 is false. This is false, since y could still be true as x could = -3. So we have not demonstrated that X and Y are logically equivalent, otherwise written as if and only if or iff.</li>
<li>A.1.4  Plug in same example: If x = 3, then x*x = 9, if x*x does not = 9, then x = 3 is false. This seems to be true to me, if x*x equals something besides 9 then x must not be 3, therefore whenever x is true, y is true, and whenever y is true, x is also true or logically equivalent.</li>
<li>A.1.5 Try some examples again. If (A) x = 3, then (B) x*x = 9. If (B)x*x = 9 is true, then (C) x*x*x = 27 is true. If (C) x*x*x = 27 is true then (A) x = 3 is true. In A.1.4 we showed that whenever x is true, y is true and whenever y is false, then x must be false. If (C) is false, then (A) must be false too, and if (C) is false then (B) is also false and you can continue on like this until you show that A iff B iff C which is logically equivalent.</li>

A warning about looking up exercise solutions online, including my own solutions. You should always plug in your own examples and work through it yourself and not trust the solutionss you find. If you look <a href="https://yehongjiang.com/math/solutions-to-taos-analysis-i-appendix-a/">here</a> the solutions are wrong for A.1.3 and A.1.4. There is a very good reason Tao has not included the answers for any of the exercises, because you are supposed to <a href="https://infinitedescent.xyz/20180214-exercises-ibl/">figure them out yourself</a> which is the only way you can even hope to learn this material enough to advance on to more difficult topics in real analysis. Of course sometimes you don't even know where to start, and looking up solutions (like my feeble solutions) can help to at least begin your own proof but you should try to write it yourself anyway to make sure the online solution is correct.

A.2 Implication seems confusing on first read, it's modern language use relating to casuality is different from the logician's use which is explained <a href="http://www.math.niu.edu/~richard/Math101/implies.pdf">here</a>. The only permutation where implication is false is if p implies q and p is true, but q is false. The negation of an implication 'If p then q' is 'p and not q'.

Proposition A.2.3, confusing the hypotenuse "Suppose that&#x2026;" by assuming the conclusion. We always assume the hypotenuse, and prove the conclusion.  Proposition A.2.6, proof by contradiction, we know that when pi/2 (90deg) the sine function is 1, because remember it is the y axis of the unit circle. Tao also makes a note here to not use confusing logical notation in proofs.  
</p>

<p>
Some good advice at the end of A.3 to keep track of which statements are known, and which statements are desired to not mix them up. A.4 clearly defines variables in math. In A.4 quantifiers, note how Tao doesn't use this notation \(\forall\) and \(\exists\) anywhere in the book, preferring plain language. Remark A.5.1 is in the above history of logic lectures about Aristotle logic.

<li>c) There is a single x++, and a single y++, such that y*y = x and this is true.</li>
<li>d) For every number in the entire set of positive numbers, there exists a single x++ such that y*y = x and this is true, 1*1 = 1, 2*2 = 4, etc.</li>

<p>
A.6 the point of the examples is to make a point about arguments that use outer variables depending on inner variables being false.

<div id="outline-container-org9874c32" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9874c32">3.1 Fundamentals (Set Theory)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9874c32">
<p>
We are back to reading Tao's <i>Analysis I</i> and still in the realm of the natural numbers. Example 3.1.2 is similar to a nested list such as [list: 1, [list: 1, 2], 100] is length 3, even though there is a nested list overall it still only contains 3 elements. Remark 3.1.3 is in the above historical lectures on set theory. We are referred to Appendix A.7 Equality to read about the substitution axiom which you should have already read.
</p>

<p>
Lemma 3.1.6 if set A is equal to set (empty), then if x is in A it must also be in set empty, a contradiction, so A must be a non-empty set is how I interpret the lemma, which is a way to say that if an empty set exists, there must also be a possibility of a non-empty set. Remark 3.1.8 Cardinality if you watched the Wildberger <i>History of Mathematics</i> <a href="#org6b19c57">lecture</a> linked above assigns a value. Remark 3.1.9 There is only one singleton set for each object A because in Axiom 3.3, y is in {a} iff y = a, and Def 3.1.4 explains the equality of sets that if every element a = y, then y = a. Set {a,b} = {b, a} and {a, a} = {a} for the same reasons, every element of one set is an element of the other. Interesting how 3.1.4 allows for duplicates since {b, b, b} is equal to {b}. Examples 3.1.10 emptyset is not equal to {emptyset} since there is an axiom that emptyset is the set with no objects in it, and there's an object in the set {emptyset}. 
</p>

<p>
Exercise 3.1.2 prove emptyset, {emptyset}, {{emptyset}}, and {emptyset{emptyset}} are all not equal.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If \(\emptyset\) = {\(\emptyset\)} then by Def 3.1.4 \(\emptyset\) \(\in \emptyset\) a contradiction to Axiom 3.2</li>
<li>Same reasoning as above for \(\emptyset\) is not equal to {{\(\emptyset\)}} or {\(\emptyset\){\(\emptyset\)}}</li>
<li>{\(\emptyset\)} is not equal to {{\(\emptyset\)}} because [list: 1] is not equal to [list: [list: 1]]. The first has element 1 in it, the second has element [list: 1]. More precisely if {\(\emptyset\)} = {{\(\emptyset\)}} then by Def 3.1.4 every element of {\(\emptyset\)} (it's only element is \(\emptyset\)) must be in {{\(\emptyset\)}} (it's only element is {\(\emptyset\)})  and vice-versa, so claiming {\(\emptyset\)} \(\in\) {\(\emptyset\)} which contradicts Axiom 3.3, where y \(\in\) {a} iff y = a. In this case y must = \(\emptyset\) to be in {\(\emptyset\)}.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Remark 3.1.21 clarifies the above exercise how {2} is not in {1,2,3} but 2 is in {1,2,3}. The rest of this chapter is straight forward definitions of set operations, better than the usual treatment of venn diagrams. Remark 3.1.26 distinct is defined as <i>there are elements of one set which are not elements of the other</i> so \(\emptyset\) and \(\emptyset\) are not distinct because neither can have elements. In Proposition 3.1.28 notice how any operation on two sets results in a new set, like a higher order filter function over a list results in a new list. 
</p>

<p>
Example 3.1.32 looks a lot like programming syntax. There seems to be an order of evaluation, applying the axiom of specification first to create a new set, then applying the axiom of replacement so working right to left in {n++ : n \(\in\) {3,5,9); n&lt;6}

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>3.1.1 Show that 3.1.4 is reflexive, symmetric and transitive as per A.7</li>
<li>Subsets could easily show this, though it's simple enough to show by 3.1.4 if every element of x is in A, and A = B, then every element of B is also in A so A = A or B = B by substitution (reflexive) and also symmetric since A = B can be substituted for B = A, and substitution used to show transitive property if A = B and B = C then A = C.</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>3.1.2 is above</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>3.1.3 prove the remaining claims in 3.1.13:</li>
<li>If x \(\in\) {a,b} then by Axiom 3.3 x = a or x = b, and from Axiom 3.4 x \(\in\) {a} or x \(\in\) {b}, so x \(\in\) {a} \(\cup\) {b} because of the appendix on disjunction.</li>
<li>The next claim, prove the union operation is commutative follows the same proof he did for the union operation is associative. Suppose x is an element of A U B. By def 3.1.4 and axiom 3.4 pairwise union then x \(\in\) A or x \(\in\) B. By disjuntion this is also x \(\in\) B or x \(\in\) A. So A U B by disjunction is B U A.</li>
<li>The next claim, prove A U A is equal to A U \(\emptyset\) is equal to \(\emptyset\) U A is equal to A. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Similar disjunction type proof using def 3.1.4 and axiom 3.4. A \(\cup\) \(\emptyset\) is x is in A or x is in \(\emptyset\) which we showed is the same as x is in \(\emptyset\) or x is in A which is the same as x is in A because of the appendix on disjunction. If x is in A or x is in the empty set that can't have anything in it, then x\(\in\) A or x\(\in\) \(\emptyset\) and we must have x\(\in\) A.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>3.1.4 prove claims in Proposition 3.1.18 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You can write both these proofs exactly like his 3.1.18 proof for transitivity. Suppose A \(\subset\) B and B \(\subset\) A. To prove that A = B we have to prove that every element A is an element of B, and every element B is an element of A by def 3.1.4. Let us pick an arbitrary element x \(\in\) A. Then, since A \(\subset\) B, x must also be an element of B. But since B \(\subset\) A, then every element of A is an element of B and every element B is an element of A. By 3.1.4 they are equal.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>3.1.15 Show how union, intersection and subset are logically equivalent:</li>

<li>Union is OR, also JOIN (think SQL syntax):
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We'll use subset to imply A U B = B is true.</li>
<li>If x is in B, then x \(\in\) A \(\cup\) B = B so two cases. If x is in B: then x is in A or x is in B, and disjunction allows us to pick either, so choose x is in B. The other case, if x is in A: because of the definition of A \(\subset\) B then x is also in B. Now we have two cases where x ended up in B so x is in A U B = B if and only if x is in B and by 3.1.4 A \(\cup\) B = B.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Intersection is AND, also MEET: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Choose arbitrary x like he did, so x is in A. If x is in A, and since we proved A U B = B where x was in B, then x is in both A and B and by definition of 3.1.23 this is an intersection and by 3.1.4 A \(\cap\) B = A.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Subset: We have a logical link between subset and union, and union and intersection. We need subset and intersection. Since we proved x is in A for A \(\cap\) B = A, and we also proved that x is in B for A \(\cup\) B = B, you can use the appendix to imply for all x in A, x is also in B and by 3.1.15 A \(\subset\) B.</li>
<li>There is another way, using the algebra of Boole to <a href="https://youtu.be/AeSt2KNUdXY">prove</a> union and intersection</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>3.1.16 Prove proposition 3.1.28
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We already showed most of these or saw a proof for them in the text and de Morgan's laws a proof exists for them everywhere including youtube. Here it is stating that the set X (a, b and c): ABC - AB = BC \(\cap\) AC which by def 3.1.23 is C = C and that ABC - A intersection B = BC U AC which is ABC, so A intersection B must be the empty set and ABC = ABC.</li>
<li>Rough proof strategy: what you want to do is get your arbitrary element into the form of the definitions for union, intersection and difference sets. Pick arbitrary element y in ABC - AB and BC \(\cap\) AC so by disjunction choose C, and the left side is simple to prove, since y is in C but not in A or B, you now have the definition of difference sets. The right side, since we just showed y is not in A or B, then y must be in in both X\A and X\B and ergo, you have the definition of intersection.</li>
<li>Second proof, we need to show a or b for the union, so select by disjunction your element in A or B. For the left side intersection, since y is not in both A and B, it's not in the form of definition for intersection so remains after subtraction. The right side y is in either side by disjunction, which is definition of union so we have ABC on the right with y in B or A and then we have the entire appendix to claim since BC U AC = ABC then all these sets must be distinct, so A intersection B is the empty set now you have ABC = ABC.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>3.1.7 'show' is never defined, so informal examples/reasoning, think through these exercises is all you have to do
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For example 'if and only if': C must be in both A and B too by definition of intersection otherwise could not be a subset of A and B as well. Sames goes for the first examples, the intersection of A and B produces elements in both sets, so will be a subset of A and B. Plug in some examples: A = {1}, B = {1,2} and C = {1}.  A \(\cap\) B = {1}, and is a subset of A and B.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>3.1.8  I'm just going off the distributive laws with a mental exercise not a proof 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First: x is in A and (x is in A or x is in B)</li>
<li>x is in A and A or x is in A and B (distributive)</li>
<li>x is in A or x is in A and B</li>
<li>x is in A by disjunction</li>
<li>Second: x is in A or (x is in A and B)</li>
<li>x is in A or A, and x is in A or B</li>
<li>x is in A and x is in A or B</li>
<li>x is in A by disjunction</li>
<li>Disjunction absorbs conjunction</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>3.1.9 Another show, so just thought exercise. If A intersection B = emptyset, then they are disjoint (have no elements in common). This is the definition of 3.1.27 difference of sets, where x is in A but not in B, so A = x - b and b = x - a if the union of A and B = X.</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>3.1.10 All I can think of is the emptyset, since emptyset U emptyset is still emptyset, and emptyset intersection emptyset is also disjoint.</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>3.1.11 There is a solution <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2107214/show-that-axiom-of-replacement-implies-from-the-axiom-of-specification-proof-ve">here</a>, but it doesn't use implication as Tao asked unless you imply that if Q(x,y) then Q(x, y and P(x)) or imply that if Q(x,w) is true for some x in A, then P(w) is true, and w = x for some x in A which implies P(w) is true and w is in A.</li>

Example 3.3.3 if you forgot range <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4396290/what-does-this-square-bracket-and-parenthesis-bracket-notation-mean-first1-last">notation</a>. Remark 3.3.5 clears up some notation for functions notably a sequence subscript also denotes a function. Example 3.3.9 asks why 3.3.7 asserts that all functions from empty-set to X are equal. Since they have the same domain and range (nothing) any application of f(x) is going to equal g(x). 
</p>

<p>
Our first proof in this chapter is in Lemma 3.3.12, and if we can go by all the previous chapters, this will be our template for the exercises. It also doesn't make sense, so I checked the errata page and sure enough there is <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/books/analysis-i/">errata</a> for this lemma. f() maps Z to W, h() maps X to Y, g() maps Y to Z. Range is the set of possible output values, and domain is the set of all input values. If f() takes Z inputs and maps to W, and g() takes Y inputs that map to Z, then f(g(y)) is Y -&gt; W. If h() takes input X and maps to Y, and g() takes Y inputs that map to Z, then g(h(x)) maps X -&gt; Z. Try following the nested functions, h(x) -&gt; Y and g(y) -&gt; Z so g(h(x)) is input X, output Z. Remark 3.3.13 details the order of operations, it's the same as in programming so f(g(h(x))) is the output of h(x) to g(), the output of g() to f(). 
</p>

<p>
Example 3.3.18 image is defined as the set of all output values a function may produce, so the function Z -&gt; Z (all the integers), that's defined f(n) = n*n, there can't be any negative numbers in it's output, so by definition 3.3.17, every element of Z can't come from applying f to some element of Z if it's defined to be f(n) = n*n however Tao then defines the set A where every element is the result of a square, now Z -&gt; A.

We're doing <i>Analysis I</i> and Linear Algebra in parallel. These sets of lectures cover Linear Algebra from a geometric approach so later when we work through Tao's Linear Algebra <a href="https://terrytao.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/linear-algebra-notes.pdf">notes</a> and take vector calculus we can understand what is happening. Reasons I decided to do this course instead of a traditional one like a Gilbert Strang course (we'll do his advanced linear algebra course in the AI workshop anyway) is it is similar to the other workshop where we are learning difficult computer science abstractions using Pyret: all the complexity is stripped away so you can just focus on building insight into how all this works which translates over to much more complex books and courses that will already assume you have this insight. The foundations of this geometry are simple and from Pappus of Alexandria's law of parallel lines.

Welcome to 320 AD in ancient Alexandria you're learning linear algebra with just parallel lines. Around 4000 years ago, the people of Babylon knew how to solve a simple 2x2 system of linear equations with two unknowns and around 200 BC the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nine_Chapters_on_the_Mathematical_Art">book</a> <i>Nine Chapters of the Mathematical Art</i> displayed how to solve a 3x3 system of equations so linear algebra in some form or another has been around a very long time.

He constructs the affine plane from scratch. The vector (8/3, 10,3) you need to full screen to better see exactly where they are. From B, you move right 2 lines, and 2/3 so \(2 + \frac{2}{3}\) which is 8/3. From there you move up 1/3, and 3 so \(3 + \frac{1}{3}\) which is 10/3. Reasons for using the affine plane are you do not impose anything on it artificially like the origin (0,0) in the Cartesian plane, you can do projections easily, and it's construction is simple, since only parallel lines. The biggest a takeaway here is what a basis vector is and how you can combine them to form larger vectors, and how to translate them to suit different perspectives. The exercises at the end the delta symbol will return in the lecture on area and the determinant.

In this optional related <a href="https://youtu.be/Nu-YPJSNFpE">lecture</a> he shows how ancient people made a ruler using just parallel line geometry, which leads to modelling the rational continuum.
