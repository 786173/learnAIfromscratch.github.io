<p>
This is a (ongoing) workshop to learn the math needed for various prereqs in university AI intro courses, and is Part IB of the so-called <a href="https://learnaifromscratch.github.io">AI Tripos</a> to get to a level of competency to satisfy prerequisites in future AI courses. No background is assumed.

<p>
This is experimental. In a regular university AI track <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/bs-in-artificial-intelligence/curriculum">curriculum</a> you would likely take 3 semesters of calculus (essentially the entire calculus book written by Stewart). You would take a linear algebra class, an intro probability class, a class about linear regression/intro to stats. You would take an 'intro to proofs' style course being flooded with strategies, and then yet another proof based class in discrete math covering a grab bag of topics. Every one of these classes you would have TAs/office hours/recitations and peer study groups to help you. 
</p>

<p>
We don't have any of these resources to help us, instead we are going to learn math by seeing it implemented with rational arithmetic, then proving simple facts about it at the same time. This way we are doing conceptually simple abstractions incrementally to more difficult abstractions and not being bombarded with a large number of advanced topics while expected to learn how a proof works at the same time. 
</p>

<p>
A few resources won't have any provided solutions, we'll be expected to figure it out ourselves. This is actually <a href="https://infinitedescent.xyz/20180214-exercises-ibl/">how you learn</a>. In definition-theorem-proof style books the author will show you dozens of proofs per chapter, and then expect you to mimic what they did in order to solve the exercises. In a way you already have the answers in each chapter and you'll see what this means when we start Terence Tao's <i>Analysis I</i>.

<p>
"We’re assuming mathematical maturity: you should be familiar with the idea of derivations and proofs, and of building formal representations for objects given their English language description. We’ll assume that you can take scalar derivatives. We’ll assume that you’ve seen real vector spaces and matrices (linear operators) and know how to reason about things like matrix multiplication and solving systems of linear equations. We’ll assume that you’ve seen sets and data types. We’ll assume that you’ve worked with probabilities (e.g., conditioning, Bayes rule)"

<p>
We're going to go through some short YouTube lectures on foundations, to learn the basics of arithmetic then rigorously redo this same material in Terence Tao's book. We will also see a few direct proofs. The reasons for doing these lectures is he defining things step by step from scratch using the easy framework of the natural numbers so you can understand exactly how fractions and division works before moving on to more complicated things. We'll probably do most of this playlist, matching lectures with other material until we can build up to doing an applied calculus book and understand it.

An interesting explanation of multiplication.

<li>Laws for multiplication
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>nm = mn (Commutative)</li>
<li>(kn)m = k(nm) (Associative)</li>
<li>n \(\cdot\) 1 = n (Identity)</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Note the different notation for multiplication:

<li>Distributive laws
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>k(n + m) = kn + km</li>
<li>(k + n)m = km + nm</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<p>
Exercise: Prove why the multiplication and distributive laws work. Since we have no idea what a proof is yet, we're just going to walk through some examples.   
</p>

<p>
Identity law: n \(\cdot\) 1 = n.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We are creating n groups of 1. According to our definition of multiplication |||| \(\cdot\) | would be 4 groups of | or ||||. This is still 4.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Commutative law: nm = mn. 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>||| \(\cdot\) || = || || || or 6. Rearranging this, || \(\cdot\) ||| is ||| ||| which is again 6.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Associative law: (kn)m = k(nm).  
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If k = |, and n = ||, and m = ||| and parens expressions are evaluated first:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Left side: (kn)m. We first evaluate (kn) as || (2 groups of 1, the identity law), and 2m is ||| ||| (2 groups of 3) for a total of 6.</li>
<li>Right side: k(nm): In the parens nm is 2 groups of 3, so ||| |||.  k(6) is the identity law, one group of 6. Thus (kn)m = k(nm).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Distributive law: (k + n)m = km + nm.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If k = ||||, and n = ||, and m = |:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Left side: (|||| + ||) is 6, and (6) x 1 is six groups of 1 or 6 according to the identity law.</li>
<li>Right side: km + nm: 4 groups of one is 4, plus two groups of 1 is 2 (identity law). Answer is again 6.</li>
</ul></li>

We're still in the natural numbers, which he defined as beginning with 1 so we aren't working with zeros yet (no division by zero corner cases). He defines the operations of addition and multiplication with fractions using the laws of division we already learned. 
</p>

<p>
Note how he sets up the proof. The 'prime' notation (the tick, so c', a', b') just represents another variable. You could rewrite this 'Suppose a/b = y/z so that a/z = b/y, and c/d = something/another, so that c/another = something/d does it then follow &#x2026;'.

What we are trying to prove is ab' = ba' and cd' = dc'. He introduces some extra notation, multiplying both sides by (dd') to help do this.

Now that you've seen some basic proofs with natural numbers, we're starting Terence Tao's <i>Analysis I</i>. Obtain the <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/books/analysis-i/">3rd edition</a> from <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/">WorldCat</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Genesis">LibGen</a> and read the preface about how these notes were originally used for a course, and why the proofs are the way they are instead of being more abstract and elegant like they are in many other analysis texts. Read a little of the introduction like how you can't blindly cancel c from both sides of ac = bc if c = 0, because then the equality makes no sense, you're dividing by zero to remove c from ac = bc. The rest of the examples in the intro we can't figure out yet since we haven't started calculus. Skip to chapter 2. I'm using the Springer 2016 3rd edition.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The five Axioms
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Axiom 2.1: 0 is a natural number</li>
<li>Axiom 2.2: If n is a natural number, then n++ is also a natural number</li>
<li>Axiom 2.3: 0 is not the successor of any natural number</li>
<li>Axiom 2.4: Different natural numbers must have different successors</li>
<li>Axiom 2.5: Let P(n) be any property pertaining to a natural number n. Suppose that P(0) is true, and suppose that whenever P(n) is true, P(n++) is also true. Then P(n) is true for every natural number n. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We make an assumption about a property P(n) being true meaning you do not prove P(n), you prove P(0) and P(n + 1) are true, and both these form a logical implication meaning that if they are both true, then your initial assumption of P(n) being true holds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Remark 2.1.10 and the template in Proposition 2.1.11 is probably the clearest definition of proof by induction I've seen. Note the example where no natural number can be 'a half number', because of the increment step n + 1. The base case of 0 (as per Axiom 2.5, and Axiom 2.1) fails if we are using 'half numbers' instead of natural numbers because if zero is a natural number, and any n++ is another natural number, the only next successive number is 1 it can't be 0.5 or -3 or 3/4. The way you should view these axioms about the natural numbers is:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>0 is an element of N</li>
<li>if x is an element of N, then so is x + 1.</li>
<li>nothing else is an element of N</li>

Proposition 2.1.16 (Recursive definitions) in the book <i>Analysis I</i>. Tao uses a function but it's definition can be read in the 3.3 functions intro. What is \(a_0\)? It's an index. Imagine a finite sequence: 1, 2, 3. Imagine indexing them: \(1_0\), \(2_1\), \(3_2\) so you can refer to each entry by it's index instead of it's value. (What's a finite <a href="https://youtu.be/LCvk0Qolt68">sequence?</a>)   
</p>

<p>
This proposition is using a new function (a rule that maps from one input to one output) every time, I'm guessing to avoid sequences where they could repeat ie 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 
</p>

<p>
Let's do an example. 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(a_0\) becomes 0 (for c = 0)</li>
<li>\(a_{0++}\) becomes \(f_1(a_1)\) or 1</li>
<li>\(a_{1++}\) becomes \(f_2(a_2)\) or 2</li>
</ul>

<p>
The proof notes Axiom 2.3 protects the value \(a_0\) from being redefined by one of the functions. His base case for this proof is \({a_0}\) which is Axiom 2.3 and he is assuming P(n) which is that the procedure will always give a single value to \({a_n}\). Axiom 2.4 is the inductive step, that this procedure will also give a single value to \(a_{m++}\). All of the Axioms are used to prove this.

<div id="outline-container-org4415c92" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org4415c92">Aside: Induction and Recursion</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4415c92">
<p>
Induction and recursion are the same concept.  As an example, the specification of a program function twoExp(n) that when given a value n, returns \(2^n\). The examples you write for this program are as follows:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>twoExp(0) = 1</li>
<li>twoExp(1) = 2</li>
<li>twoExp(2) = 4</li>
<li>twoExp(3) = 8</li>
<li>twoExp(4) = 16</li>
<li>twoExp(5) = 32</li>
</ul>

<p>
You notice the pattern: the result of the next value, is 2x the previous value. twoExp(5) is 2 * twoExp(4). You write an algorithm using the above examples: if input = 0, then return 1, otherwise return 2 * twoExp(n-1). You make an assumption, that the input will always be non-negative. Walking through the program execution, twoExp(3) evaluates:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>2 * twoExp(3-1)</li>
<li>2 * (2 * twoExp(2-1))</li>
<li>2 * (2 * (2 * twoExp(1-1)))</li>
<li>2 * (2 * (2 * (1))) = \(2^3\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
To prove this by induction on n, we try the base case P(0). If n = 0 then twoExp(0) evaluates to 1, which is \(2^0\). What is P(n)? According to our recursive definition, n = 2*P where the value of P = twoExp(n-1) or \(2^{n-1}\). Our inductive step is n, since our algorithm is inductively defined n-1, and we wish to prove the successor n + 1, which is n. 2*P = \(2*2^{n-1}\) or \(2^n\). 
</p>

<p>
Note that we didn't have to do anything extra to prove this recursive function. That's because an inductive proof is a recursive function, and a recursive function is an inductive proof.

<h3 id="org8205552">2.2 Addition</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8205552">
<p>
Let's understand his example for addition. 3 + 5 should be the same as (((5++)++)++) and adding 0 to 5 should just give 5.  
</p>


<p>
Definition 2.2.1 notice he has a base case (0 + m is m), the hypotenuse "Suppose we inductively defined how to add n to m" which we just saw at the beginning of 2.2 where 3 + 5 is defined as incrementing five three times, finally the inductive step, we can add n++ to m by defining (n++) + m to be (n + m)++. 
</p>

<p>
Try writing your own examples
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>0 + m = m</li>
<li>1 + m = ((0++) + m) or m++</li>
<li>2 + m = ((1++) + m) or ((m++)++)</li>
<li>3 + m = ((2++) + m) or (((m++)++)++)</li>
<li>4 + m = ((3++) + m) or ((((m++)++)++)++)</li>
<li>2 + 3 = ((3++)++) or (4++) or 5.</li>
<li>3 + 2 = (((2++)++)++) or ((3++)++) or (4++) or 5.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Lemma 2.2.2 notice first how he is using the exact same induction template from 2.1.11, you will eventually get very familiar with this template. Also notice how he's using prior established definitions to set up the proofs, notably definition 2.2.1 where it was defined 0 + m = m. He assumed that n + 0 = n. Next the inductive step, where n++ + 0 = n++. No arithmetic was done here, he pointed to the definition of addition from 2.2.1 that n++ + 0 is (n + 0)++ or n++, so we have n++ = n++ and the proof is done. 
</p>

<p>
He used a different variable to not confuse it with the previously established definition of 0 + m = m, since we are now going the other way with n + 0 = n on our way to prove a + b = b + a.
</p>


<p>
Lemma 2.2.3 Prove: n + (m++) = (n + m)++. We are inducting on n, and keeping m fixed which means we want to prove n++ not m++. Replace all instances of n with 0 for the base case and show the inductive hypothesis holds that 0 plus the increment of some other number, equals that number. Try writing this proof yourself to follow it:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>base case:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>0 + (m++) = (0 + m)++</li>
<li>left side is m++ because of definition 2.2.1</li>
<li>right side is m++ because of definition 2.2.1</li>
</ul></li>
<li>inductive hypotenuse n + m++ = (n + m)++</li>
<li>inductive step:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>n++ + (m++) = (n++ + m)++</li>
<li>left side is  ((n + m)++)++ because of 2.2.1</li>
<li>right side is ((n + m)++)++ because of 2.2.1</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Corollary:
Tao asks why n++ = n + 1 is a consequence from the two proved lemmas. Compare lemma 2.2.3 <i>For any natural numbers n and m, n + (m++) = (n + m)++</i> to definition 2.2.1 where we were able to show m++ = m + 1. Compare lemma 2.2.2 to the base case in definition 2.2.1
</p>

<p>
Proposition 2.2.4 (Addition is commutative) the base case is straight forward. We use the definition of addition, and lemma 2.2.2 to rewrite the successor of n to be (n + m)++ = (m + n)++ and now it is in the form of the inductive hypothesis, so we can use our hypothesis of n + m = m + n to show that (m + n)++ is the same as (n + m)++. Proposition 2.2.6 is similar.

<p>
You should try this yourself, move everything around until you understand exactly how commutativity and associativity work. See if you can get it to a form where you can use the inductive hypothesis, permute them around some more until this starts to make sense. Remember to think as (n + m) as one value, so (n++) + (n + m) is (n + (n + m))++ and (n + (n + m)) can be rewritten according to commutative property ((n + m) + n).

Proposition 2.2.6 (Cancellation Law) uses Axiom 2.4 which states '<i>Different natural numbers must have different successors; i.e., if n, m are natural numbers and n = m, then n++ = m++. Equivalently, if n++ = m++, then we must have n = m</i>'. So (a + b)++ = (a + c)++ is = a + b = a + c by the line <i>if n++ = m++, then n = m</i> in axiom 2.4. We dropped down from the successor by using axiom 2.4 and can now just use our inductive hypothesis of the cancellation law for a to show b = c and close the induction. . 
</p>

<p>
Lemma 2.2.10 has an exercise where induction is suggested. For the base case it's clear we can't use a, since (b++) = 0 would violate Axiom 2.3 that zero is not the successor of any natural number. So it must be b, (0++) = a, which by the definition of addition tells us (0++) = 1, which confirms our base case test that 'there exists exactly one natural number who's successor is a' since if a is 1, it can only be (0)++. This is already true by Axiom 2.4 where different natural numbers have different successors, and if you induct on b then you'll just end up with the definition of addition (b++)++ = a.

<li>d does not need to be positive for 0 \(\le\) b</li>
<li>if b = 0, then by corollary 2.2.9 b = 0 + 0   
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>b = 0 or 0 = b</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
a &gt; b then a++ &gt; b 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">

<li>a++ = b + (c++) (substitution)
<ul class="org-ul">

<ul class="org-ul">

<p>
a = b, then a++ &gt; b

Proposition 2.2.14 (Strong induction) If you remember the <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/video-lectures/lecture-3-strong-induction/">lecture</a> on strong induction the intuition here is Q(m) if all the dominoes are already knocked down and there's just one left standing, then it too will be knocked down whereas 'weak induction' intuition is P(n) if you knock down one domino, they will all fall. If P(n) is true because P(n++) implies P(n) true, then for all m \(\le\) P(n), Q(m) is true.  
</p>

<p>
First look up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth">vacuous truth</a> or see the appendix on mathematical reasoning where Tao defines it. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Let Q(n) be the property that P(m) is true for all m\(_0\) \(\le\) m &lt; n for n \(\ge\) m\(_0\).</li>
<li>Q(0) is true since: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>m\(_0\) \(\le\) m &lt; 0 is vacuously true as stated by Tao in the exercise hint</li>
<li>2.2.14 proposition of for all n \(\ge\) m\(_0\) is true 0 \(\ge\) 0\(_0\)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Show that Q(n++) is true:</li>
<li>P(m) m\(_0\) \(\le\) m \(\lt\) n \(\lt\) n++ is true (2.2.11)</li>
<li>implies that P(m) m\(_0\) \(\le\) m \(\lt\) n++ is true for all n \(\ge\) m\(_0\)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Try an example. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>P(n) is the property that n + 0 = n</li>
<li>Q(0) is 0 + 0 = 0 and P(0)</li>
<li>Q(1) is 1 + 0 = 1 and P(1), P(0)</li>
<li>Q(2) is 2 + 0 = 2 and P(2), P(1), P(0)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Exercise 2.2.6: Your proof could roughly be 'Suppose P(n++) is true such that all P(m) is true for m \(\le\) n++. Then per Axiom 2.5 P(n) is true, so P(m) is true for all m \(\le\) n' since Tao hinted at 'backwards induction'.

<li>Remove the + 0 (lemma 2.2.2)</li>
<li>Now it is in the form of the IH: n x 0 = 0</li>
</ul>

<p>
Lemma Y: m x (n++) is m + (n x m), rewriting Lemma 2.2.3 but for multiplication 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li>IH: m x (n++) = m + (n x m)</li>
<li>Inductive step: m x (n++)++ = m + (n++ x m)</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org36c10ae">
<p>
The hint is to prove the second statement first, if n and m are both positive, then nm is also positive. You could use Proposition 2.3.6 as a template for this:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If n &gt; 0, and m &gt; 0, then nm &gt; 0</li>
<li>We have nm = 0 + d for some positive d</li>
<li>Since d is positive, n and m must be positive (or else 0 = 0 + d, a contradiction)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Or you could use Lemma 2.2.10, n x m = (b++) x m and then mimic 2.3.6 to determine n x m is positive if n and m are positive. Note that (b++) x m expands to the form (b x m) + b, and since you know a x b + a is the successor form of multiplication it can't be zero. 
</p>

<p>
Lemma 2.3.3: n x m = 0 iff n = 0 or m = 0. You could try a contradiction using the nm &gt; 0 proof we just wrote, so it must be n = 0 or m = 0 if nm = 0 or a contrapositive of Tao's statement: if n x m is not positive, then nm = 0. See the appendix on mathematical reasoning. If Tao states something, and then proves it, then there is a contrapositive statement we can use to prove another fact. 'If x then y, then if not x, it can't be y'.

Prove proposition 2.3.9 by fixing q and inducting on n for n = mq + r and 0 \(\le\) r \(\lt\) q
</p>

<p>
For the base case, if 0 = mq + r, then m and r must be zero because this still satisfies the inequality where q is greater than r and remember we fixed q, so it can't be zero. For the inductive step, n + 1 = mq + r + 1 (adding + 1 to both sides as per previous lectures on induction), we have two cases, r + 1 &lt; q or r + 1 \(\le\) q. If r + 1 &lt; q then we have the inductive hypothesis and there's nothing more to prove since 0 \(\le\) r + 1 \(\lt\) q. Remember the order of multiplication/addition, this is still (number) = (number) plus n in the form of (n + 1) = (mq) + (r + 1). 
</p>

<p>
If r + 1 \(\le\) q, or (r = q), then we have n + 1 = mq + q, and from the definition of multiplication/distributive law this is n + 1 = (m + 1)q or m++(q) + 0 and 0 still satisfies the inequality of r &lt; q.

<h3 id="org68ab436">Reading: Axler</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org68ab436">
<p>
The mindset we gained from interpreting the axioms of natural numbers to build up arithmetic will help us interpret the rules of algebra. We'll start with the <a href="http://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=4AE2E9C7A89341481EBA3BA448B31ADE">book</a> <i>Algebra &amp; Trigonometry</i> by Axler but not read it in a linear way. Hilariously in <i>preface to instructors</i> on page xvi, Axler claims to have purposely screwed with the typeset for the exercises to deter students from just doing the exercises without reading the main text, since the way you're supposed to learn math while working through any text is to write your own examples for each definition you come across.    
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org855905f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org855905f">1.1 The Real Line</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org855905f">
<p>
First we learn about algebraic structures and are introduced to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDBLXCFrihc">integers</a>. Next we extend arithmetic to the <a href="https://youtu.be/MDMG9Ljb8l0">Rational field</a>, and see how the rational line is represented in a <a href="https://youtu.be/83ZjYvkdzYI">plane</a> where the rational line is offset by one to avoid division by zero. This is a highly complex structure, as shown <a href="https://youtu.be/gATEJ3f3FBM">here</a> where looking at a small segment is the same complexity as looking at a much larger segment. A binary <a href="https://youtu.be/CiO8iAYC6xI">tree</a> of fractions reveals the Fibonnaci pattern and it's generation by 3 <a href="https://youtu.be/qPeD87HJ0UA">matrices</a> (a problem in the book <i>Concrete Math</i>) further reveals just how complex the structure is. Still the rational number line contains gaps as the Axler book explains. The Real number line includes the Rational line and fills the gaps where irrational numbers should be on the line, such as the square root of 2. The proof by contradiction that no rational number has a square equal to 2 is simple substitution we've already seen, \(m^2\) = 2\(n^2\) is determined to be even since 2x a number makes it even, so substitute m = 2k to show this: \((2k)^2\) = \(2n^2\). We saw this in the geometry lectures.       
</p>

<p>
In the two examples, remember the roughnums from cs019. If you add a number to a roughnum you get a roughnum back. The problems will be hard to solve since we don't know yet if you can multiply two squares such as sqrt(2) x sqrt(2) and get sqrt(4) which is rational. You could also sum three numbers: rational + (irrational) - (irrational) and cancel the two irrational numbers, leaving the rational. Can you cancel an infinite decimal by adding it to it's negative self? We'll have to keep reading to find out.

We are already familiar with all these properties, review this chapter in case you forgot anything. Try working through an example yourself before looking at the answer. In Example 9 Axler laments nobody can hand caculate square roots anymore which we already learned in the above algebra lectures. The last few examples use Wolfram Alpha symbolic calculator, there are numerous math software programs floating around which can do anything in this text or you can write your own Pyret libraries as you go through the course to make your own software.

<li>51: Show that \((a + 1)^2\) = \(a^2 + 1\) iff a = 0

This is similar to what we've already seen in Tao's book, we know that a &lt; b implies (b - a) is positive because there exists some positive d that a &lt; b + d so b - a finds d.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org150fa86">
<p>
Again let's try some of the psets, these are harder than usual since some of this we haven't seen yet. 
</p>

<details>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>57: We know this from Tao, a &lt; b because (b - a) is positive, a = b because (b - a) is 0, and a &gt; b because (a - b) is positive.</li>
<li>58: Add to each inequality to find a transitive rule we can use: a + c &lt; b + c and c + b &lt;= d + b implies a + c &lt; d + b because of transitivity.</li>
<li>59: a &lt; b is positive since (b - a). A positive plus a positive will be greater.</li>
<li>60: Try subtracting c/d from a+c/b+d and see if you get a/b</li>
<li>61: Try some examples. If (x, y) contains zero there is some interval where y - x is 0 implying they are both centered around 0. We'll learn the proof of this in a calculus class later I'm sure.</li>
<li>62: (2, 5) U [3, 4] is {x: 2 &lt; x &lt; 5} and {x: 3 &lt;= x &lt;= 4}. The set of numbers in at least one of these sets equals {x: 2 &lt; x &lt; 5} or (2, 5).</li>
<li>63: If a &lt; b and c &lt; d, then c - b &lt; d - a. The solution here is something to do with the transitive property, try adding to both sides. If a + c &lt; b + c, and c + b &lt; d + b then a + c &lt; d + b and now move variables around: c - b &lt; d - a.</li>
<li>64: If a &lt; b and c &lt; d then ac &lt; bd. Transitivity trick again: ac &lt; bc and cb &lt; db. ac &lt; bd because bc &lt; db.</li>
<li>65: If 0 &lt; a &lt; b and 0 &lt; c &lt; d then a/d &lt; b/c. ac/dc &lt; ba/ac. multiply by dc/1: ac &lt; bd now manipulate fraction (multiply both sides by 1/c, 1/d) to get a/d &lt; b/c.</li>
<li>66: Definition of intersection was only in the exercises, on page 34 if you're wondering, not in the content of the chapter.</li>
<li>69: If the question was |8x - 3| = 2 then this is solvable, but -2 violates the definition of absolute value where |absval| = positive/or zero.</li>
<li>70: The square of a negative number is positive, and the distance is the same</li>
<li>71 through 73: The definition of absval in the beginning of the chapter where the distance from zero of |ab| is the same as |a|*|b|</li>
<li>74:  Not an interval means it skips numbers, like the set of primes. All I can think of is the set {10, sqrt(100)} since 10 + sqrt(100)/2 is 10.</li>
<li>75: Triangle inequality we haven't taken yet, absolute value are like parenthesis so |a + b| you would combine those first then take it's absolute value. This triangle inequality is explained <a href="https://www.expii.com/t/triangle-inequality-for-absolute-values-10002">here</a>. So if b &lt; 0, then |a - b| &lt;= |a| + |-b| which is |a - b| &lt;= |a| + |b| because of the absval rules we can change |-b| to positive. Note the inequality holds since a - b &lt;= a + b. If a &lt; 0, then |b - a| &lt;= |-a| + |b| which is again |b - a| &lt;= |a| + |b| and equality holds.</li>
<li>76: For ab &lt; 0, one has to be negative, and neither can be 0 or else ab = 0. Since this is strictly greater, then b - a is also positive. You want to manipulate this inequality somehow to show the answer ab &lt; 0, moving things around to each side, subtracting a or b or both to get |terms| &lt; 0.</li>

Section 2.1 of Axler's book. Already we get confusing notation, where points are the same notation as intevals. This is why I enjoy those Wildberger lectures he designs his definitions to not mix up notation. Axler also uses rational exponents then defers to chapter 5.1 to <a href="https://www.expii.com/t/evaluating-rational-exponents-4456">explain</a> how they work. If you want a crash course on square roots/nth roots, see <a href="https://www.expii.com/t/what-is-a-square-root-4586">this</a> expii video. Eventually when the Axler chapter comes up we will review these things in <a href="https://www.expii.com/t/radicals-exponents-and-logs-in-depth-4986">depth</a> and even moreso in calculus.

You don't have to memorize these formulas you can always look them up as you need to. We will be doing geometry with vectors later instead of points.

<h3 id="org91da525">Lectures about pi</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org91da525">
<p>
Wildberger <a href="https://youtu.be/lcIbCZR0HbU">talks</a> about the history of pi and how we'll need Calculus to understand it. He rants about real numbers here and their construction (we'll see the construction in Tao's book later) then talks about the history of pi, such as Archimedes interval for pi, Newton's formula, a hexadecimal version of pi, his own formula. The end of this lecture he points out pi is clearly some kind of complex object that isn't just a number. At this stage we just need to know it's a constant, maybe think of it as an algorithm that produces an infinite series stapled on to the real line or the applied approximation Axler uses of 22/7 or 355/113.  
</p>

<p>
Knuth has numerous lectures about pi, such as 'Why Pi' where probabilities end up creating a 3D ball geometric representation. Knuth has snuck pi into <i>The Art of Computer Programming</i> series in a few volumes even in <a href="https://youtu.be/3DKo219ZHMw">balanced ternary form</a>.

<li>52: Plug those points (frac, frac), (x, y) into the slope formula, remember a fraction over another fraction is division, so you flip one fraction over and multiply them both.

<h2 id="orgcd7d5d0">Trigonometry Boot Camp</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcd7d5d0">
<p>
Let's take the Brown Univeristy trig <a href="http://www.math.brown.edu/~dkatz/trigbootcamp/">boot camp</a>. Anything that doesn't make sense in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qvZ8-9IxiI">video</a> look it up directly in Axler's text such as the chapter on angles, or circles though we are totally dispensing with angles and using radians.   
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Radians remember 90deg is pi/2 and 360deg is 2pi. 180deg is then pi.  
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You could even make up your own notation and define it as dblpi = 6.283&#x2026; and then 360deg is dblpi, 90deg is 1/4dblpi, 180deg is dblpi/2, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Angles as directions, assume we are moving a pointer rotating it around the circle</li>
<li>We really only need to know sine and cosine functions, all others are derived from them</li>
<li>Unit circle is the first example in Axler's book chapter 9 on trig</li>
<li>cos() is the x coord, sin() is the y coord on that unit circle. If cos(pi/2) (90deg) is (0,1) then cos(pi) will be (-1, 0) on the unit circle. cos(2pi) will be a full rotation to (1, 0). sin(3pi/2) would be one rotation to 90deg pointing straight up, another 90deg rotation pointing left, then another pointing straight down at (0, 1) so sin(3pi/2) = 1 and cos(3pi/2) = 0.</li>
<li>In the scaling of triangles example where \(\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\) becomes \(\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}\) we already rationalized the denominator in one of the axler exercises:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\cdot\frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt 2}\) is \(\frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt 2 \cdot \sqrt 2}\)</li>
<li>\(\frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt 4}\) is \(\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}\)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can download the <a href="http://www.math.brown.edu/~dkatz/trigbootcamp/trigbootcamp-presentationslides.pdf">slides</a> to keep a copy of the scaled triangles</li>
<li>Radius is on page 79 of the Axler book, it's half the diameter of the circle</li>
<li>The reflections think about subtracting 1/6 from 1/1, you get 5/6 so 5pi/6 is pi (180 deg) minus 1pi/6, and a negative direction means we are moving clockwise so move to pi, subtract pi/6 in other direction.</li>
<li>Take note about the reflections being outside the range of 0 and pi/2(90deg).</li>
<li>The end of the lecture we finally discover why sin() and cos() are wave functions, since it's just a unit circle moving around</li>
<li>Tan() is the slope 'rise over run'</li>
</ul>

<p>
Try the <a href="http://www.math.brown.edu/~dkatz/trigbootcamp/trigbootcamp-practiceworksheet.pdf">worksheet</a> you can actually draw these out and just count rotations if you want. The equations if one side is squared, then you need to take the square root of both sides so it's (not-squared = value) instead of (squared thing = value-when-squared). If you're stuck watch the video that walks through all the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQo2SXbasC4">solutions</a> then do the worksheet again until you can finish it without needing to look at the video walkthru. 
</p>

<p>
How I solved these: subtract 1 pi or if less than pi a 1/2 pi and see what you get, look at the 3 triangles and see if they have a corresponding value for sin/cos.

<li>Gilbert Strang's <i>Calculus</i>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
After we finish these we will know how to apply existing AI algorithms in a black box kind of way, and this is where almost every online AI resource ends. You have problem X, here is off the shelf solution Y and we'll be sophisticated enough to tweak these algorithms and even can make money doing this professionally as some kind of applied AI engineer in an interesting startup or even in a medical research lab if we take some additional <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLypiXJdtIca6U5uQOCHjP9Op3gpa177fK">courses</a>.
</p>

<p>
Eventually we'll want to understand how these algorithms actually work, or maybe how to design our own if no existing solution fits. We are likely also interested in identifying bias or in the security of our deep learning network to prevent it from being fooled by false data. All this equates to putting in the time learning more sophisticated techniques so we can take slightly more advanced AI courses in machine learning, natural language processing and deep learning:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Some researchers believe higher-dimensional dependent type theory can not only be construed as a programming language, but also as a <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/talks/MURI20-talk.pdf">foundation</a> for all of mathematics. It would be interesting to start with counting sticks at the beginning of this workshop like we did in the natural numbers lecture, and somewhere in the future end up in a wildly abstract universe in order to count sticks again.</li>

This seems like an impossible list but just focus on the 4 intro courses, which is less than most students take in a single semester in university. Once you realize you can survive those and it didn't take your entire lifetime to finish, you can then survive intermediate level courses.

<b>Algorithm for proceeding</b>

Set the smallest goal possible, like completing an hourly task, once that is accomplished set another hourly or daily task. One day do some calculus, next day try some programming in the software section, next day try a single lecture in linear algebra, next day do a single lecture in probability and repeat.
