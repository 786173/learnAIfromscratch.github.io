This is a (ongoing) workshop to learn the math needed for various prereqs in university AI intro courses, and is Part IB of the so-called <a href="https://learnaifromscratch.github.io">AI Tripos</a> to get to a level of competency to satisfy prerequisites in future AI courses. No background is assumed.

This is experimental. In a regular university <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/bs-in-artificial-intelligence/curriculum">curriculum</a> you would likely take 3 semesters of calculus (essentially the entire calculus book written by Stewart). You would take a linear algebra class, an intro probability class, a class about linear regression/intro to stats. You would take an 'intro to proofs' style course being flooded with advanced strategies, and then yet another proof based class in discrete math covering an enormous grab bag of topics. Every one of these classes you would have TAs/office hours/recitations and peer study groups to help you. 
</p>

<p>
We don't have any of these resources to help us, or the motivation to complete them in the beginning. So we need to do things differently, it's just us by ourselves trying to figure out this material. University you have a specific goal: graduate and not lose all your tuition money, and you work towards that single goal of graduation and drives you to complete the material. You're given a strict schedule to follow until you graduate. However doing this yourself, there is no schedule, and ample opportunity to just quit at anytime because quitting is consequence free for us. So that's what most people do. 
</p>

<p>
Instead we are going to learn basic math by proving simple facts about it at the same time. This way we are doing conceptually simple abstractions incrementally to more difficult abstractions and not being bombarded with a large number of advanced topics while expected to learn how a proof works at the same time. We're also going to learn things like polynomials from the lens of linear algebra from the start. We're also just going to backfill whatever we need on the way.
</p>

<p>
A few resources won't have any provided solutions, we'll be expected to figure it out ourselves. This is actually <a href="https://infinitedescent.xyz/20180214-exercises-ibl/">how you learn</a>. In definition-theorem-proof style books the author will show you dozens of proofs per chapter, and then expect you to mimic what they did in order to solve the exercises. In a way you already have the answers in each chapter and you'll see what this means when we start Terence Tao's <i>Analysis I</i>, and his Linear Algebra notes. 
</p>

<p>
Because all this is experimental it could fail, but you'll still know more about math than if you spent the same time in a massive precalculus book.

<blockquote>
<p>
"We’re assuming mathematical maturity: you should be familiar with the idea of derivations and proofs, and of building formal representations for objects given their English language description. We’ll assume that you can take scalar derivatives. We’ll assume that you’ve seen real vector spaces and matrices (linear operators) and know how to reason about things like matrix multiplication and solving systems of linear equations. We’ll assume that you’ve seen sets and data types. We’ll assume that you’ve worked with probabilities (e.g., conditioning, Bayes rule). We will also assume familiarity with coding. The assignments will be in Python."

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4fd43bc">
<p>
We're going to go through some short YouTube lectures on foundations, to learn the basics of arithmetic then rigorously redo this same material in Terence Tao's book. We will also see a few direct proofs. The reasons for doing these lectures is he defining things step by step from scratch using the easy framework of the natural numbers so you can understand exactly how fractions and division works before moving on to more complicated things. We'll probably do most of this playlist, matching lectures with other material until we can build up to doing an applied calculus book and understand it.

An interesting explanation of multiplication.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Laws for addition

<li>n + m = m + n (Commutative)

<li>Laws for multiplication
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>nm = mn (Commutative)</li>
<li>(kn)m = k(nm) (Associative)</li>
<li>n \(\cdot\) 1 = n (Identity)</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Note the different notation for multiplication:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>nm</li>
<li>n \(\cdot\) m</li>
<li>n \(\times\) m</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Distributive laws
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>k(n + m) = kn + km</li>
<li>(k + n)m = km + nm</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<p>
Exercise: Prove why the multiplication and distributive laws work. Since we have no idea what a proof is yet, we're just going to walk through some examples.   
</p>

<p>
Identity law: n \(\cdot\) 1 = n.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We are creating n groups of 1. According to our definition of multiplication |||| \(\cdot\) | would be 4 groups of | or ||||. This is still 4.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Commutative law: nm = mn. 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>||| \(\cdot\) || = || || || or 6. Rearranging this, || \(\cdot\) ||| is ||| ||| which is again 6.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Associative law: (kn)m = k(nm).  
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If k = |, and n = ||, and m = ||| and parens expressions are evaluated first:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Left side: (kn)m. We first evaluate (kn) as || (2 groups of 1, the identity law), and 2m is ||| ||| (2 groups of 3) for a total of 6.</li>
<li>Right side: k(nm): In the parens nm is 2 groups of 3, so ||| |||.  k(6) is the identity law, one group of 6. Thus (kn)m = k(nm).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Distributive law: (k + n)m = km + nm.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If k = ||||, and n = ||, and m = |:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Left side: (|||| + ||) is 6, and (6) x 1 is six groups of 1 or 6 according to the identity law.</li>
<li>Right side: km + nm: 4 groups of one is 4, plus two groups of 1 is 2 (identity law). Answer is again 6.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="orga177a32">Subtraction and division</h4>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/mVd202X-2uM">YouTube</a> - Arithmetic and Geometry Math Foundations 4</li>
</ul>

<p>
Subtraction is the inverse of addition
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If k + m = n then k = n - m</li>
<li>Note: n - m is only defined if n &gt; m as we are still in the realm of the Naturals and negative numbers/integers aren't yet defined.</li>
</ul>

<p>
+, -, are binary operations and can only do 2 operations at a time
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Laws of Subtraction:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>n - (m + k) = (n - m) - k</li>
<li>n + (m - k) = (n + m) - k</li>
<li>n - (m - k) = (n - m) + k</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Distributive laws of subtraction:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>n(m - k) = nm - nk</li>
<li>(n - m)k = nk - mk</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Note to remove parens: <a href="https://www.themathpage.com/alg/parentheses.htm">https://www.themathpage.com/alg/parentheses.htm</a> we can just drop the grouping enforcement when using addition (associative law) but must distribute the negative sign, as subtraction is not associative.  
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>n - (m + k) = (n - m) - k
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>removing grouping: n - m - k = n - m - k</li>
</ul></li>

We're still in the natural numbers, which he defined as beginning with 1 so we aren't working with zeros yet (no division by zero corner cases). He defines the operations of addition and multiplication with fractions using the laws of division we already learned. 
</p>

<p>
Note how he sets up the proof. The 'prime' notation (the tick, so c', a', b') just represents another variable. You could rewrite this 'Suppose a/b = y/z so that a/z = b/y, and c/d = something/another, so that c/another = something/d does it then follow &#x2026;'. 
</p>

<p>
What we are trying to prove is ab' = ba' and cd' = dc'. He introduces some extra notation, multiplying both sides by (dd') to help do this.

Now that you've seen some basic proofs with natural numbers, we're starting Terence Tao's <i>Analysis I</i>. Obtain the <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/books/analysis-i/">3rd edition</a> from somewhere and read the preface about how these notes were originally used for a course, and why the proofs are the way they are instead of being more abstract and elegant like they are in many other analysis texts. Read a little of the introduction like how you can't blindly cancel c from both sides of ac = bc if c = 0, because then the equality makes no sense ie: 2x0 = 3x0, you're dividing by zero to remove c from ac = bc. The rest of the examples in the intro we can't figure out yet since we haven't started calculus. Skip to chapter 2. I'm using the Springer 2016 3rd edition. This will be an ongoing book we do in parallel with other courses at the same time. We won't be able to solve all the exercises but the point is to think about the problems enough and see enough proofs that we begin to understand <i>mathematical thinking</i>.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The five Axioms
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Axiom 2.1: 0 is a natural number</li>
<li>Axiom 2.2: If n is a natural number, then n++ is also a natural number</li>
<li>Axiom 2.3: 0 is not the successor of any natural number</li>
<li>Axiom 2.4: Different natural numbers must have different successors</li>
<li>Axiom 2.5: Let P(n) be any property pertaining to a natural number n. Suppose that P(0) is true, and suppose that whenever P(n) is true, P(n++) is also true. Then P(n) is true for every natural number n. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What this translates to is: We make an assumption about a property P(n) being true, for example you are looking at a sequence of numbers, and you figure out that there is a pattern where you are able to deduce the next number in the sequence. You call your hypothesis P(n), and you <i>assume</i> this is true meaning you do not show P(n), you show P(0) and P(n+1) are true, and both these form a logical implication meaning that if they are both true, then your initial assumption of P(n) being true holds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Remark 2.1.10 and the template in Proposition 2.1.11 is probably the clearest definition of induction I've seen. P means 'property'. Note the example where no natural number can be 'a half number', because of the increment step n++. The base case of 0 (as per Axiom 2.5, and Axiom 2.1) fails if we are using 'half numbers' instead of natural numbers because if zero is a natural number, and any n++ is another natural number, the only next successive number is 1 it can't be 0.5 or -3 or 3/4. The way you should view these axioms about the natural numbers is:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>0 is an element of N</li>
<li>if x is an element of N, then so is x + 1.</li>
<li>nothing else is an element of N</li>

<p>
Proposition 2.1.16 (Recursive definitions) in the book <i>Analysis I</i>. In a way Tao kind of broke his preface rule here where beginning material will not rely on later material, as he doesn't define what a function is and starts using one. He will tell us exactly what it is eventually but for now we can consider it a rule or mapping. If you read the 3.3 functions intro Tao will explain what they are though using sets. What's a set? Read 3.1.1. What is \(a_0\)? It's an index. Imagine a finite sequence: 1, 2, 3. Imagine indexing them: \(1_0\), \(2_1\), \(3_2\) so you can refer to each entry by it's index instead of it's value. (What's a finite <a href="https://youtu.be/LCvk0Qolt68">sequence?</a>)   
</p>

<p>
This proposition is using a new function every time, I'm guessing to avoid sequences where they could repeat ie 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4&#x2026;. 
</p>

<p>
Let's do an example. 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(a_0\) becomes 0 (for c = 0)</li>
<li>\(a_{0++}\) becomes \(f_1(a_1)\) or 1</li>
<li>\(a_{1++}\) becomes \(f_2(a_2)\) or 2</li>
</ul>

<p>
The proof notes Axiom 2.3 protects the value \(a_0\) from being redefined by one of the functions. His base case for this proof is \({a_0}\) which is Axiom 2.3 and he is assuming P(n) which is that the procedure will always give a single value to \({a_n}\). Axiom 2.4 is the inductive step, that this procedure will also give a single value to \(a_{m++}\). All of the Axioms are used to prove this.

<div id="outline-container-org4675ebd" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org4675ebd">Aside: Induction and Recursion</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4675ebd">
<p>
Induction and recursion are the same concept.  As an example, the specification of a program function twoExp(n) that when given a value n, returns \(2^n\). The examples you write for this program are as follows:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>twoExp(0) = 1</li>
<li>twoExp(1) = 2</li>
<li>twoExp(2) = 4</li>
<li>twoExp(3) = 8</li>
<li>twoExp(4) = 16</li>
<li>twoExp(5) = 32</li>
</ul>

<p>
You notice the pattern: the result of the next value, is 2x the previous value. twoExp(5) is 2 * twoExp(4). You write an algorithm using the above examples: if input = 0, then return 1, otherwise return 2 * twoExp(n-1). You make an assumption, that the input will always be non-negative. Walking through the program execution, twoExp(3) evaluates:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>2 * twoExp(3-1)</li>
<li>2 * (2 * twoExp(2-1))</li>
<li>2 * (2 * (2 * twoExp(1-1)))</li>
<li>2 * (2 * (2 * (1))) = \(2^3\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
To prove this by induction on n, we try the base case P(0). If n = 0 then twoExp(0) evaluates to 1, which is \(2^0\). What is P(n)? According to our recursive definition, n = 2*P where the value of P = twoExp(n-1) or \(2^{n-1}\). Our inductive step is n, since our algorithm is inductively defined n-1, and we wish to prove the successor n + 1, which is n. 2*P = \(2*2^{n-1}\) or \(2^n\). 
</p>

<p>
Note that we didn't have to do anything extra to prove this recursive function. That's because an inductive proof is a recursive function, and a recursive function is an inductive proof.

<h3 id="org379d62c">2.2 Addition</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org379d62c">
<p>
Let's understand his example for addition. 3 + 5 should be the same as (((5++)++)++) and adding 0 to 5 should just give 5.  
</p>


<p>
Definition 2.2.1 notice he has a base case (0 + m is m), the hypotenuse "Suppose we inductively defined how to add n to m" which we just saw at the beginning of 2.2 where 3 + 5 is defined as incrementing five three times, finally the inductive step, we can add n++ to m by defining (n++) + m to be (n + m)++. 
</p>

<p>
Try writing your own examples
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>0 + m = m</li>
<li>1 + m = ((0++) + m) or m++</li>
<li>2 + m = ((1++) + m) or ((m++)++)</li>
<li>3 + m = ((2++) + m) or (((m++)++)++)</li>
<li>4 + m = ((3++) + m) or ((((m++)++)++)++)</li>
<li>2 + 3 = ((3++)++) or (4++) or 5.</li>
<li>3 + 2 = (((2++)++)++) or ((3++)++) or (4++) or 5.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Lemma 2.2.2 notice first how he is using the exact same induction template from 2.1.11, you will eventually get very familiar with this template. Also notice how he's using prior established definitions to set up the proofs, notably Definition 2.2.1 where it was defined 0 + m = m. He assumed that n + 0 = n. Next the inductive step, where n++ + 0 = n++. No arithmetic was done here, he pointed to the definition of addition from 2.2.1 that n++ + 0 is (n + 0)++ or n++, so we have n++ = n++ and the proof is done. 
</p>

<p>
He used a different variable to not confuse it with the previously established definition of 0 + m = m, since we are now going the other way with n + 0 = n on our way to prove a + b = b + a.
</p>


<p>
Lemma 2.2.3 Prove: n + (m++) = (n + m)++. We are inducting on n, and keeping m fixed which means we want to prove n++ not m++. Replace all instances of n with 0 for the base case and show the inductive hypothesis holds that 0 plus the increment of some other number, equals that number. Try writing this proof yourself to follow it:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>base case:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>0 + (m++) = (0 + m)++</li>
<li>left side is m++ because of definition 2.2.1</li>
<li>right side is m++ because of definition 2.2.1</li>
</ul></li>
<li>inductive hypotenuse n + m++ = (n + m)++</li>
<li>inductive step:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>n++ + (m++) = (n++ + m)++</li>
<li>left side is  ((n + m)++)++ because of 2.2.1</li>
<li>right side is ((n + m)++)++ because of 2.2.1</li>

<h4 id="org96734f9">Corollary</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org96734f9">
<p>
Tao asks why n++ = n + 1 as a consequence from the two proved lemmas. These questions are designed to help you learn this material by figuring it out for yourself to develop this kind of thinking. Compare Lemma 2.2.3 <i>For any natural numbers n and m, n + (m++) = (n + m)++</i> to Definition 2.2.1 where we were able to show m++ = m + 1. Compare Lemma 2.2.2 to the base case in Definition 2.2.1
</p>

<p>
How would you rewrite 2.2.1 for a new, second definition of n++ = n + 1 like he did for m++ = m + 1 so we can now show n++ = n + 1?
</p>

<p>
Proposition 2.2.4 (Addition is commutative) the base case is straight forward. The inductive part is different, we use the definition of addition, and lemma 2.2.2 to rewrite the successor of n to be (n + m)++ = (m + n)++ and now it is in the form of the inductive hypothesis, so we can use our hypothesis of n + m = m + n to show that (m + n)++ is the same as (n + m)++. Proposition 2.2.6 is similar.

Proposition 2.2.5 (Addition is associative) what we want to prove is (a + b) + c = a + (b + c). You don't have to be able to do these exercises, just try them and see if you can mimic what the author has been doing. Let's grab the inductive template and fill it in.

<li><a id="org1d2ec94"></a>Base Case<br>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org1d2ec94">
<p>
What is the base case? We want to show that even if a natural number is inside or outside brackets, it will have the same result when added together. We could pick b, then it would be (a + 0) + c = a + (0 + c) and from lemma 2.2.2/definition of addition, we would know this to be a + c = a + c but that doesn't seem to capture what we're trying to prove, and all of Tao's previous base cases we've seen tried to show what he was trying to prove not a trick to make both sides equal. Instead let's pick c or a, as on each side of the equality they are either inside the bracket, or outside it. 
</p>

<p>
(a + b) + 0 = a + (b + 0) (substitute 0 for c)
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>left side: (a + b) + 0</li>
<li>since b + 0 = b (lemma 2.2.2) then we have:</li>
<li>a + (b + 0) (lemma 2.2.2)</li>
<li>base case: a + (b + 0) = a + (b + 0)</li>
<li>or right side: a + (b + 0)</li>
<li>since b + 0 = b (lemma 2.2.2) then we have:</li>
<li>(a + b) + 0</li>
<li>another base case: (a + b) + 0 = (a + b) + 0</li>

</p>

<li><a id="orgf0337b8"></a>Inductive step<br>

There's a few ways to show this. I'm just going to move stuff around randomly and you can see where the proof is:
</p>

<p>
(a + b) + (c++) = a + (b + (c++))
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>right side: a + (b + (c++))</li>
<li>a + (b + c)++ (lemma 2.2.3)</li>
<li>((a + b) + c)++ (by the IH)</li>
<li>((a + b)++) + c (def of addition)</li>
<li>((b + a)++) + c (commutative)</li>
<li>((b++)+ a) + c (def of addition)</li>
<li>c + ((b++) + a) (commutative)</li>
<li>c + (a + (b++)) (commutative)</li>
<li>left side: (a + b) + (c++)</li>
<li>(c++) + (a + b) (commutative)</li>
<li>(c + (a + b))++ (def of addition.. consider (a + b) to be one value
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Recall (n++) + m = (n + m)++ ergo (n++) + (m + b) is (n + (m + b))++</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>((a + b) + c)++ (commutative)</li>
<li>(a + (b + c))++ (by the IH)</li>
<li>((b + c) + a)++ (commutative)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>etc., can keep moving these around</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
You should try this yourself, move everything around until you understand exactly how commutativity and associativity work. See if you can get it to a form where you can use the inductive hypothesis, permute them around some more until this starts to make sense. Remember to think as (n + m) as one value, so (n++) + (n + m) is (n + (n + m))++ and (n + (n + m)) can be rewritten according to commutative property ((n + m) + n).
</p>


<p>
Proposition 2.2.6 (Cancellation Law) uses Axiom 2.4 which states '<i>Different natural numbers must have different successors; i.e., if n, m are natural numbers and n = m, then n++ = m++. Equivalently, if n++ = m++, then we must have n = m</i>'. So (a + b)++ = (a + c)++ is = a + b = a + c by the line <i>if n++ = m++, then n = m</i> in axiom 2.4. We dropped down from the successor by using axiom 2.4 and can now just use our inductive hypothesis of the cancellation law for a to show b = c and close the induction. Notice how this is basically logical detective work, you look around for axioms and prior established lemmas and proofs to help you write a new proof. 
</p>

<p>
Lemma 2.2.10 has an exercise where induction is suggested. For the base case it's clear we can't use a, since (b++) = 0 would violate Axiom 2.3 that zero is not the successor of any natural number. So it must be b, (0++) = a, which by the definition of addition tells us (0++) = 1. The inductive hypothesis is that there exists exactly one natural number b, such that b++ = a, but this is already true by Axiom 2.4 where different natural numbers have different successors.
