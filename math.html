This is a (ongoing) workshop to learn the math needed for various prereqs in university AI intro courses, and is Part IB of the <a href="https://learnaifromscratch.github.io">AI Tripos</a>. No background is assumed. The idea here is that you do this workshop until you can figure out the courses in the AI workshop and then can either continue doing both or switch, up to you. We start by writing proofs of basic arithmetic with the natural numbers and work our way up. Proof writing is a skill you practice like every other skill, if you persist and practice it enough eventually you pick up the skill.  I watch a lecture one day, next day read some of a chapter, mainly 1 - 2 hrs a day sometimes less or more on the weekends but I try and do it everyday.

<p>
At first, your proofs will just be complete sentences that are a convincing argument to yourself. You don't need to have them verified or a solutions guide. The act of re-reading definitions, experimenting around with the examples, and trying to follow the logic is <a href="https://infinitedescent.xyz/20180214-exercises-ibl/">how you learn math</a>. Remember when you learned to read and write, at first you just naively scribbled unaware your composition skills were terrible until you took more advanced grammar classes in school, and you began to see other people's writing to compare to your own. Then through experience you got better. This is same deal for proofs. You will naively scribble until we take enough logic (grammar) you can check your own proofs. You will read other people's more elegant proofs in books and online, and can at that point understand what they are doing because you have experience. Wwe will see some proof theory and constructive logic that will help us verify our own arguments, and use proof assistants so we can run our proofs as code.

<h4 id="org562a43a">Make your own examples</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org562a43a">
<p>
If you write all your own examples everytime you come across something being defined, many of the exercises will be trivial to complete. Write them like you would example tests in the software workshop, find all the corner cases and see if the definition or lemma holds. Remember why we write examples in that workshop, it's to learn more about the problem domain since there may be subtle things that escaped our understanding. It's the same deal here, and usually those subtle things end up as exercises so if you've already done your own examples you already know the answer.

Presented here is a definition of a mathematical object called a natural number, as a string or sequence of strokes, which are successors of each other. ie: the successor of a number, is another number.

<p>
An interesting explanation of multiplication.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Laws for addition
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>n + m = m + n (Commutative)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Changing the order of the elements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(k + n) + m = k + (m + n) (Associative)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Changing the grouping of the elements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>n + 1 = s(n) (Successor)</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Laws for multiplication
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>nm = mn (Commutative)</li>
<li>(kn)m = k(nm) (Associative)</li>
<li>n \(\cdot\) 1 = n (Identity)</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Note the different notation for multiplication:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>nm</li>
<li>n \(\cdot\) m</li>
<li>n \(\times\) m</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Distributive laws
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>k(n + m) = kn + km</li>
<li>(k + n)m = km + nm</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<p>
Exercise: Prove why the multiplication and distributive laws work. Since we have no idea what a proof is yet, we can instead try going through some of our own examples.   
</p>

<p>
Identity law: n \(\cdot\) 1 = n.
</p>

We're still in the natural numbers, which he defined as beginning with 1 so we aren't working with zeros yet (no division by zero corner cases). He defines the operations of addition and multiplication with fractions using the laws of division we already learned.

<p>
Note how he sets up the proof. The 'prime' notation (the tick, so c', a', b') represents another variable. You could rewrite this 'Suppose a/b = y/z so that a/z = b/y, and c/d = something/another, so that c/another = something/d does it then follow &#x2026;'.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The five Axioms
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Axiom 2.1: 0 is a natural number</li>
<li>Axiom 2.2: If n is a natural number, then n++ is also a natural number</li>
<li>Axiom 2.3: 0 is not the successor of any natural number</li>
<li>Axiom 2.4: Different natural numbers must have different successors</li>
<li>Axiom 2.5: Let P(n) be any property pertaining to a natural number n. Suppose that P(0) is true, and suppose that whenever P(n) is true, P(n++) is also true. Then P(n) is true for every natural number n. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We make an assumption about a property P(n) being true meaning you do not prove P(n), you prove P(0) and P(n + 1) are true, and both these form a logical implication meaning that if they are both true, then your initial assumption of P(n) being true holds.</li>

<p>
Remark 2.1.10 and the template in Proposition 2.1.11 is probably the clearest definition of proof by induction I've seen. Note the example where no natural number can be 'a half number', because of the increment step n + 1. The base case of 0 (as per Axiom 2.5, and Axiom 2.1) fails if we are using 'half numbers' instead of natural numbers because if zero is a natural number, and any n++ is another natural number, the only next successive number is 1 it can't be 0.5 or -3 or 3/4. The way you should view these axioms about the natural numbers is:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>0 is an element of N</li>
<li>if x is an element of N, then so is x + 1.</li>
<li>nothing else is an element of N</li>

Proposition 2.1.16 (Recursive definitions) in the book <i>Analysis I</i>. Tao uses a function, it's definition can be read in chapter 3.3. Here \(a_0\) is function notation so \(a_0\) is \(f_0(0)\), \(a_1\) is \(f_1(1)\). This proposition is using a new function (a rule that maps from one input to one output) every time, I'm guessing to avoid sequences where they could repeat ie 0, 1, 1, 2, 3.. 
</p>

<p>
Let's do an example. 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(a_0\) becomes 0 (for c = 0)</li>
<li>\(a_{0++}\) becomes \(f_1(a_1)\) or 1</li>
<li>\(a_{1++}\) becomes \(f_2(a_2)\) or 2</li>
</ul>

<p>
The proof notes Axiom 2.3 protects the value \(a_0\) from being redefined by one of the functions. His base case for this proof is \({a_0}\) (Axiom 2.3) and he is assuming P(n) which is that the procedure will always give a single value to \({a_n}\). Axiom 2.4 is the inductive step, that this procedure will also give a single value to \(a_{m++}\). All of the Axioms are used to prove this. If this didn't make sense it will when we come back here in chapter 3.5 for an exercise.

<h4 id="org329c1df">Aside: Induction and Recursion</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org329c1df">
<p>
Induction and recursion are the same concept.  As an example, the specification of a program function twoExp(n) that when given a value n, returns \(2^n\). The examples you write for this program are as follows:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>twoExp(0) = 1</li>
<li>twoExp(1) = 2</li>
<li>twoExp(2) = 4</li>
<li>twoExp(3) = 8</li>
<li>twoExp(4) = 16</li>
<li>twoExp(5) = 32</li>
</ul>

<p>
You notice the pattern: the result of the next value, is 2x the previous value. twoExp(5) is 2 * twoExp(4). You write an algorithm using the above examples: if input = 0, then return 1, otherwise return 2 * twoExp(n-1). You make an assumption, that the input will always be non-negative. Walking through the program execution, twoExp(3) evaluates:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>2 * twoExp(3-1)</li>
<li>2 * (2 * twoExp(2-1))</li>
<li>2 * (2 * (2 * twoExp(1-1)))</li>
<li>2 * (2 * (2 * (1))) = \(2^3\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
To prove this by induction on n, we try the base case P(0). If n = 0 then twoExp(0) evaluates to 1, which is \(2^0\). What is P(n)? According to our recursive definition, n = 2*P where the value of P = twoExp(n-1) or \(2^{n-1}\). Our inductive step is n, since our algorithm is inductively defined n-1, and we wish to prove the successor n + 1, which is n. 2*P = \(2*2^{n-1}\) or \(2^n\). 
</p>

<p>
Note that we didn't have to do anything extra to prove this recursive function. That's because an inductive proof is a recursive function, and a recursive function is an inductive proof.

<p>
Let's understand his example for addition. 3 + 5 should be the same as (((5++)++)++) and adding 0 to 5 should result in 5.  
</p>


<p>
Definition 2.2.1 notice he has a base case (0 + m is m), the hypotenuse "Suppose we inductively defined how to add n to m" which we saw at the beginning of 2.2 where 3 + 5 is defined as incrementing five three times, finally the inductive step, we can add n++ to m by defining (n++) + m to be (n + m)++. 
</p>

<p>
Try writing your own examples as advised in the book <i>How to Think Like a Mathematician</i>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>0 + m = m</li>
<li>1 + m = ((0++) + m) or m++</li>
<li>2 + m = ((1++) + m) or ((m++)++)</li>
<li>3 + m = ((2++) + m) or (((m++)++)++)</li>
<li>4 + m = ((3++) + m) or ((((m++)++)++)++)</li>
<li>2 + 3 = ((3++)++) or (4++) or 5.</li>
<li>3 + 2 = (((2++)++)++) or ((3++)++) or (4++) or 5.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Lemma 2.2.2 notice first how he is using the exact same induction template from 2.1.11, you will eventually get very familiar with this template. He's using prior established definitions to set up the proofs, notably definition 2.2.1 where 0 + m = m is defined. He assumed that n + 0 = n. Next the inductive step, where (n++) + 0 = n++. No arithmetic was done here, he pointed to the definition of addition from 2.2.1 that (n++) + 0 is (n + 0)++ or n++, so we have n++ = n++ and the proof is done. He used a different variable to not confuse it with the previously established definition of 0 + m = m, since we are now going the other way with n + 0 = n on our way to prove a + b = b + a.
</p>


<p>
Lemma 2.2.3 Prove: n + (m++) = (n + m)++. We are inducting on n, and keeping m fixed which means we apply the inductive step to n++ instead of m++. Replace all instances of n with 0 for the base case and show the inductive hypothesis holds that 0 plus the increment of some other number, equals that number. Try picking apart this proof yourself to follow it:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>base case:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>0 + (m++) = (0 + m)++</li>
<li>left side is m++ because of definition 2.2.1</li>
<li>right side is m++ because of definition 2.2.1</li>
</ul></li>
<li>inductive hypotenuse: 'Suppose n + m++ = (n + m)++'</li>
<li>inductive step:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>n++ + (m++) = (n++ + m)++</li>
<li>left side is  ((n + m)++)++ because of 2.2.1</li>
<li>right side is ((n + m)++)++ because of 2.2.1</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Corollary: Tao asks why n++ = n + 1 is a consequence from the two proved lemmas. Compare lemma 2.2.3 <i>For any natural numbers n and m, n + (m++) = (n + m)++</i> to definition 2.2.1 where we were able to show m++ = m + 1. Compare lemma 2.2.2 to the base case in definition 2.2.1
</p>

<p>
Proposition 2.2.4 (Addition is commutative) the base case is straight forward. We use the definition of addition, and lemma 2.2.2 to rewrite the successor of n to be (n + m)++ = (m + n)++ and now it is in the form of the inductive hypothesis, so we can use our hypothesis of n + m = m + n to show that (m + n)++ is the same as (n + m)++. Proposition 2.2.6 is similar.

Remember a proof at our early level is just a convicing argument to yourself. To check that it is correct, all the forms have to already have been introduced in the text, for example say Tao has only defined 0 + b = 0 but not b + 0 = 0 + b. We can't assume b + 0 = 0 + b unless it has already been proved (or you write your own lemma for it) so if Tao has only shown 0 + b = 0, you can still do a dance where you claim b = 0 and then by substitution claim it's also 0 = b but you can't directly assume anything because 'it's obvious'. This is a hard skill to learn, spotting assumptions, we will take more courses on logic later and practice this skill. I've probably incorrectly assumed things in my own feeble attempts at the exercises, keep that in mind if you look at my proof scratchwork.

<details>

<p>
Proposition 2.2.5 (Addition is associative) what we want to prove is (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
</p>


<p>
<b>Base Case</b>: What is the base case? We want to show that if a natural number is inside or outside brackets, it will have the same result when added together. Induct on any variable (a, b or c) you want. This will use substitution, which is in the appendix. If we say x = y, then every future occurrence of y we can substitute for x:
</p>

<p>
(a + b) + 0 = a + (b + 0) (substitute 0 for c)
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>left side: (a + b) + 0 since b + 0 = b (lemma 2.2.2) then we have:</li>
<li>a + (b + 0) (lemma 2.2.2)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>base case: a + (b + 0) = a + (b + 0)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>or choose a: right side: 0 + (b + c) = b + c by definition of addition</li>
<li>lef side: (0 + b) + c by definition of addition
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>another base case: 0 + (b + c) = 0 + (b + c)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>IH</b>:
The inductive hypothesis (IH) we assume addition is associative, and that (a + b) + c = a + (b + c). If any steps of your proof are in the form (a + b) + c or a + (b + c) you can substitute them for each other by the IH, since we declared them equal. For example: y + a + (b + c). Note a + (b + c) is the form of our hypothesis, so can change this to y + (a + b) + c 
</p>

<p>
<b>Inductive step</b>: There's a few ways to show this, I'll move stuff around randomly and you can see where the proof is:
</p>

<p>
Inducting on c: (a + b) + (c++) = a + (b + (c++))
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>right side: a + (b + (c++))</li>
<li>a + (b + c)++ (lemma 2.2.3)</li>
<li>((a + b) + c)++ (by the IH)</li>
<li>((a + b)++) + c (def of addition)</li>
<li>((b + a)++) + c (commutative)</li>
<li>((b++)+ a) + c (def of addition)</li>
<li>c + ((b++) + a) (commutative)</li>
<li>c + (a + (b++)) (commutative)</li>
<li>left side: (a + b) + (c++)</li>
<li>(c++) + (a + b) (commutative)</li>
<li>(c + (a + b))++ (def of addition.. consider (a + b) to be one value
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Recall (n++) + m = (n + m)++ ergo (n++) + (m + b) is (n + (m + b))++</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>((a + b) + c)++ (commutative)</li>
<li>(a + (b + c))++ (by the IH)</li>
<li>((b + c) + a)++ (commutative)

<p>
Try moving everything around until you understand exactly how commutativity and associativity work. See if you can get it to a form where you can use the inductive hypothesis, substitute and permute them around some more until this starts to make sense. Remember that (n + m) is one value, so (n++) + (n + m) is (n++) + (value) which we know from the text can be written as the form  (n + (n + m))++, and (n + (n + m)) can be rewritten according to commutative property ((n + m) + n) because it's just (n + (value)) so ((value) + n) changes nothing. .

Proposition 2.2.6 (Cancellation Law) uses Axiom 2.4 which states '<i>Different natural numbers must have different successors; i.e., if n, m are natural numbers and n = m, then n++ = m++. Equivalently, if n++ = m++, then we must have n = m</i>'. So (a + b)++ = (a + c)++ is = a + b = a + c by the line <i>if n++ = m++, then n = m</i> in axiom 2.4. We dropped down from the successor by using axiom 2.4 and can now use our inductive hypothesis of the cancellation law for a to show b = c and close the induction. . 
</p>

<p>
Lemma 2.2.10 has an exercise where induction is suggested but this is actually much easier to prove using contradiction (See Kevin Houston book). Always read the <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/books/analysis-i/#comment-447019">comments</a> on Tao's blog if you're stuck: "You can modify the statement of the exercise to an equivalent statement which makes sense for a=0. (The statement will probably look something like “For any natural number a, either a=0, or else there exists exactly one…”.)" If you see this stackexchange <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3392788">answer</a> they use the peano axioms of 2.2 existence and 2.4 uniqueness. We can also try the chapter on contradiction proofs in Kevin Houston's book or the appendix of <i>Analysis</i>: Suppose for the sake of contradiction that that there exists two different natural numbers with the same successor. Then a = m++ and b = m++. But then by Axiom 2.4 we have a = b, a contradiction.  
</p>

<p>
Definition 2.2.11 n is greater or equal to m if n = m + some other natural number. If that number is 0, then the equality holds, if that number is 0++ then the inequality holds.

Try and figure these out yourself before looking at my interpretation. If you naively just wrote down your own argument why you think something is true while going back over all the text, and it was completely wrong, you'd still learn more than looking at my notes. It's better to do it yourself then later we will go through all of Tao's chapter on Mathematical Reasoning, and take a course in Proof Theory, then you will understand how to manipulate definitions by declaring them logically equivalent, making writing proofs and checking them for correctness much easier.

Proposition 2.2.12 / Exercise 2.2.3: Prove the basic properties of order for natural numbers. Here I will show how you can 'reverse' or unravel lemma 2.2.2 or other proved proposition, none of this is a properly written proof only notes on moving through steps to understand the problem then after write a proof in the style Tao has been teaching us. We just want to point to definitions and lemmas here not use induction:   
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Order is reflexive</b></li>
<li>Reflexive property is that any natural number is equal to itself.</li>
<li>We want to show order is reflexive: a \(\ge\) a</li>
<li>a = a + n (def 2.2.11 of ordering of natural numbers)</li>
<li>From lemma 2.2.2 we know that  a + 0 = a and so a = a and is reflexive</li>
<li>By definition 2.2.11 we also have a \(\ge\) a</li>
<li><b>Transitive order property</b></li>
<li>a \(\ge\) b and b \(\ge\) c, then a \(\ge\) c</li>
<li>If a = b + 0, b = c + 0, and a = c + 0, then we have lemma 2.2.2 and transitivity (equality) holds with a = b, b = c and a = c.</li>
<li>Substitution:</li>
<li>a = b + n</li>
<li>b = c + n
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>b is equal to (c + n) so let's put that in place of b in a = b + n:</li>
</ul></li>
<li>a = (c + n) + n</li>
<li>a = c + (n++)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>By lemma 2.2.10 we have a = c + m since b++ will always equal some nonzero natural number.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>By definition 2.2.11 a = c + m is a \(\ge\) c + m</li>
</ul>

<p>
Proof attempt, though we could write our own def or lemma that a + b = a natural number it's largely implied by everything we've read so far: By the definition of Ordering of the natural numbers, if a = b + m and b = c + n, then a = c + m + n. By associativity a = c + (m + n) and since if a = b when m or n are 0, then a = c when m and n are 0. By substitution d = m + n, and since m and n are natural numbers, d is a natural number by the Peano axioms and 2.1.3 (m + n)++ = d++, and by Axiom 2.4 (m + n) = d so we have a = c + d as desired by the definition of Ordering of the natural numbers.

Proposition 2.2.14 (Strong induction) From MIT this <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/video-lectures/lecture-3-strong-induction/">lecture</a> on strong induction, the intuition here is Q(m) if all the dominoes are already knocked down and there's one left standing, then it too will be knocked down where 'weak induction' intuition is P(n) if you knock down one domino, they will all fall. If P(n) is true because P(n++) implies P(n) true, then for all m \(\le\) P(n), Q(m) is true. If you still don't get it search Youtube for another tutorial.   
</p>

<p>
First look up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth">vacuous truth</a> or see the appendix on mathematical reasoning where Tao defines it. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Let Q(n) be the property that P(m) is true for all m\(_0\) \(\le\) m &lt; n for n \(\ge\) m\(_0\).</li>
<li>Q(0) is true since: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>m\(_0\) \(\le\) m &lt; 0 is vacuously true as stated by Tao in the exercise hint</li>
<li>2.2.14 proposition of for all n \(\ge\) m\(_0\) is true 0 \(\ge\) 0\(_0\)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Show that Q(n++) is true:</li>
<li>P(m) m\(_0\) \(\le\) m \(\lt\) n \(\lt\) n++ is true (2.2.11)</li>
<li>P(m) m\(_0\) \(\le\) m \(\lt\) n++ is true for all n \(\ge\) m\(_0\)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Try an example. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>P(n) is the property that n + 0 = n</li>
<li>Q(0) is 0 + 0 = 0 and P(0)</li>
<li>Q(1) is 1 + 0 = 1 and P(1), P(0)</li>
<li>Q(2) is 2 + 0 = 2 and P(2), P(1), P(0)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Exercise 2.2.6: Your proof could roughly be 'Suppose P(n++) is true such that all P(m) is true for m \(\le\) n++. Then per Axiom 2.5 P(n) is true, so P(m) is true for all m \(\le\) n' since Tao hinted at 'backwards induction'.

<b>Exercise 2.3.1</b> 
n x m = m x n:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>base case: 0 x m = m x 0</li>
<li>left side: 0 x m = 0 by definition 2.3.1</li>
</ul>

<p>
For the right side, m x 0 = 0, write your own lemma that mimics 2.2.2 but for multiplication:
</p>

<p>
Lemma X: For any natural number n, n x 0 = 0:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>base case: 0 x 0 = 0</li>
<li>IH: n x 0 = 0</li>
<li>Inductive step: (n++) x 0 = 0</li>
<li>(n x 0) + 0 = 0 (def 2.3.1)</li>
<li>Remove the + 0 (lemma 2.2.2)</li>
<li>Now it is in the form of the IH: n x 0 = 0</li>
</ul>

<p>
Lemma Y: m x (n++) is m + (n x m), rewriting Lemma 2.2.3 but for multiplication 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>base case: Our lemma X and def 2.3.1</li>
<li>IH: m x (n++) = m + (n x m)</li>
<li>Inductive step: m x (n++)++ = m + (n++ x m)</li>

<li>Left:

<li>m + (n++ x m) by IH</li>
<li>m + (n x m) + m by def 2.3.1</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Right:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>m + (n x m) + m by def 2.3.1</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Now we have to prove m x n = n x m 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>base case: def 2.3.1 and lemma X</li>
<li>IH: m x n = n x m</li>
<li>m x n++ = n++ x m</li>
<li>Lemma Y = def 2.3.1</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.3.2</b>
</p>

<p>
The hint is to prove the second statement first, if n and m are both positive, then nm is also positive. You could use Proposition 2.3.6 as a template for this:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If n &gt; 0, and m &gt; 0, then nm &gt; 0</li>
<li>We have nm = 0 + d for some positive d</li>
<li>Since d is positive, n and m must be positive (or else 0 = 0 + d, a contradiction)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Or you could use Lemma 2.2.10, n x m = (b++) x m and then mimic 2.3.6 to determine n x m is positive if n and m are positive. Note that (b++) x m expands to the form (b x m) + b, and since you know a x b + a is the successor form of multiplication it can't be zero. 
</p>

<p>
Lemma 2.3.3: n x m = 0 iff n = 0 or m = 0. You could try a contradiction using the nm &gt; 0 proof we already wrote, so it must be n = 0 or m = 0 if nm = 0 or a contrapositive of Tao's statement: see the appendix on mathematical reasoning or look up contrapositive in Houston's book. If Tao states something, and then proves it, then there is a contrapositive statement we can use to prove another fact.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.3.3</b>
A rewrite of 2.2.5: For any natural numbers a, b c, we have (a x b) x c = a x (b x c). You could induct on b, convert to the 2.3.1 form, and rearrange whenever you move something around and it is in the form of the inductive hypotenuse.
</p>

<p>
Tao also suggests using the distributive law:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Inductive Step: (a x b++) x c = a x (b++ x c)</li>
<li>(a(b++)c) = (a(b++)c) by distributed law</li>
<li>(ac(b++)) = (ac(b++)) by commutative law</li>
<li>(ac(b + 1)) = (ac(b + 1)) by corollary n++ = n + 1</li>
<li>acb + ac = acb + ac by distributed law again
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>cancellation law the two +ac:</li>
<li>acb = acb or (ab)c = a(bc)</li>
<li>or permute any way you want like we did for 2.2.5</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<p>

</p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li>aa + ba + ab + bb by distributive law</li>
<li>a\(^2\) + ba + ab + b\(^2\) by def 2.3.11/Examples 2.3.12</li>
<li>ba + ab is ba + ba by commutative law</li>
<li>ba + ba is 2ba by def 2.3.1 where 2 x m = 0 + m + m</li>
<li>(a + b)\(^2\) = a\(^2\) + 2ab + b\(^2\)</li>
</ul>


<p>
<b>Exercise 2.3.5</b>
</p>

<p>
Prove proposition 2.3.9 by fixing q and inducting on n for n = mq + r and 0 \(\le\) r \(\lt\) q
</p>

<p>
For the base case, if 0 = mq + r, then m and r must be zero because this still satisfies the inequality where q is greater than r and remember we fixed q, so it can't be zero. For the inductive step, n + 1 = mq + r + 1 (adding + 1 to both sides as per previous lectures on induction), we have two cases, r + 1 &lt; q or r + 1 \(\le\) q. If r + 1 &lt; q then we have the inductive hypothesis and there's nothing more to prove since 0 \(\le\) r + 1 \(\lt\) q. Remember the order of multiplication/addition, this is still (number) = (number) plus n in the form of (n + 1) = (mq) + (r + 1). 
</p>

<p>
If r + 1 \(\le\) q, or (r = q), then we have n + 1 = mq + q, and from the definition of multiplication/distributive law this is n + 1 = (m + 1)q or m++(q) + 0 and 0 still satisfies the inequality of r &lt; q.

Wildberger has a unique encoding of polynomials in the rest of his math foundations <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5A714C94D40392AB">playlist</a> by abstracting coefficients into columns and rows. Pascal's array is then used, and things like factoring or polynomial division is surprisingly trivial to do. Later in the same playlist he teaches some algebraic calculus using this polynumber encoding and taking derivatives and doing integration is again trivial arithmetic. They could teach this to primary school kids. If you have time, I highly recommend watching the rest of the playlist.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6b173d3">
<p>
Before we do trig, let's learn what \(\pi\) is. Wildberger <a href="https://youtu.be/lcIbCZR0HbU">talks</a> about the history of pi such as Archimedes interval for pi, Newton's formula, a hexadecimal version of pi, his own formula. The end of this lecture he claims pi is some kind of complex object we still don't understand. At this stage we only need to know it's a constant, or the applied approximation of 22/7 or 355/113.

<h2 id="orgaf80853">Trigonometry Boot Camp</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgaf80853">
<p>
Let's take the Brown Univeristy trig <a href="http://www.math.brown.edu/~dkatz/trigbootcamp/">boot camp</a>. There is a crash course <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qvZ8-9IxiI">lecture</a>. I assume you know the basic gist of what an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle">angle</a> is which will be better defined when we take calculus.   
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Radians you could even make up your own notation and define it as dblpi = 6.283… and then 360deg is dblpi, 90deg is 1/4dblpi, 180deg is dblpi/2, etc.</li>
<li>We really only need to know sine and cosine functions, all others are derived from them</li>
<li>In the scaling of triangles example where \(\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\) becomes \(\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}\) they are rationalizing the denominator:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\cdot\frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt 2}\) is \(\frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt 2 \cdot \sqrt 2}\) which is \(\frac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt 4}\) or \(\frac{\sqrt 2}{2}\)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can download the <a href="http://www.math.brown.edu/~dkatz/trigbootcamp/trigbootcamp-presentationslides.pdf">slides</a> to keep a copy of the scaled triangles</li>
<li>The reflections think about subtracting 1/6 from 1/1, you get 5/6 so 5pi/6 is pi (180 deg) minus 1pi/6, and a negative direction means we are moving clockwise so move to pi, subtract pi/6 in other direction.</li>
<li>The end of the lecture we finally discover why sin() and cos() are wave functions, since it's a function that moves around the unit circle. Tan() is the slope 'rise over run'</li>
</ul>

<p>
Summary: There exists 3 triangles, which we should know their measurements, and scale them down since this is a unit circle with maximum x and y values of 1. Then we superimpose the triangles in the pi/2 (90deg) angle space on the unit circle in such a way that we have known values of cos()/sin() and other trig functions, because we can derive those other functions from cosine and sine. We reflect these triangles into the other areas of the circle so we can get x/y values there as well by rotating around the circle and then adding up all the angles to indicate how much we rotated counter-clockwise (positive) and clockwise (negative). A reflection is demonstrated <a href="https://youtu.be/aCypVdCNgWE">here</a> so if f(x) = sin(x), cos(x) and tan(x) then y = -(fx). 
</p>

<p>
Try the <a href="http://www.math.brown.edu/~dkatz/trigbootcamp/trigbootcamp-practiceworksheet.pdf">worksheet</a> you can actually draw these out and count rotations if you want or use this radian to angle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)#/media/File:Degree-Radian_Conversion.svg">picture</a> from Wikipedia. The equations if one side is squared, then you need to take the square root of both sides so it's (not-squared = value) instead of (squared thing = value-when-squared). If you're stuck watch the video that walks through all the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQo2SXbasC4">solutions</a> then do the worksheet again until you can finish it without needing to look at the video walkthru. 
</p>

<p>
How I solved these: subtract 1 pi if it's bigger than 2pi, or a 1/2pi if smaller and see what you get, look at the 3 triangles if they have a corresponding value for sin/cos. If not subtract pi/3, pi/6 etc. If you're wondering why we are using radians instead of degrees it is explained <a href="https://youtu.be/CnQXRdgN_7I">here</a>. Wildberger's rational trigonometry uses a turn, so pi/2 is 1/4, pi is 1/2, and 2pi is 1. Angles are replaced by 'the spread of vectors'.

<h3 id="orge9f99b2">Some Calculus</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge9f99b2">
<p>
Now that we know trig functions, watch this basics of calculus <a href="https://youtu.be/zfHEkt-1sqo">crash course</a> which was designed for non-english speaking students to learn math notation (with Chinese subtitles). Note in the last few examples how the derivative works d = \(nx^{n-1}\) so in the examples the derivative of \(y = \frac{-g}{2}t^2+v_0t+y_0\) is (\(2\cdot\frac{-g}{2}t^{2-1}+ 1\cdot v_0t^{1-1}\)) or \(-gt + v_0\) you take the exponent power, multiply the coefficient of the base, and subtract the power, so the derivative of  \(-gt^1 + v_0\) is (\(1\cdot-gt^0 + v_0\)) which is -g, as we'll see later any terms without a variable (in this example t) cancels out or as Wildberger mentioned are so small so they are discarded.  
</p>

<p>
Summary: if you know the acceleration, then you integrate to find the velocity, then integrate again to find the position. If you know the position, you take a derivative to find it's velocity, and take another derivative to find the acceleration. One function tells you how another function is changing. These are also higher order functions we learned in CS019, where a function produces another function. 
</p>

<p>
Try reading the first chapter from Gilbert Strang's <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/">calculus</a> and see if you understand it. His book was designed for self-learning, so that first chapter assumes little background and builds up this intuition of one function that tells you about another. There is also a <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-005-highlights-of-calculus-spring-2010/highlights_of_calculus/big-picture-of-calculus/">lecture</a> for this chapter and a self-study <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/study-guide/">guide</a> that acts as a recitation.

This chapter on set theory in <i>Analysis I</i> relies on the fact that you've already read the appendix on logic and have an idea what implies means or disjunction. Now that we have done some proofs ourselves, and the basics of trigonometry we can finally understand some of the examples he uses in this appendix. Tao makes a point that this chapter is meant to be read and understood not studied and memorized, and thankfully he is not bombarding us with piles of confusing logic notation that you normally see in other 'how to do proofs' books. At the same time you read this appendix, read <i>How to Think Like a Mathematician</i> by K. Houston it will clear up any cryptic definitions like how implication works.

Proposition A.2.3, confusing the hypotenuse "Suppose that&#x2026;" by assuming the conclusion. We always assume the hypotenuse, and prove the conclusion.  Proposition A.2.6, proof by contradiction, we know that when pi/2 (90deg) the sine function is 1, because remember it is the y axis of the unit circle.

<div id="outline-container-orgff89390" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgff89390">3.1 Fundamentals (Set Theory)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgff89390">
<p>
We are back to reading Tao's <i>Analysis I</i> and still in the realm of the natural numbers. Example 3.1.2 is similar to a nested list such as [list: 1, [list: 1, 2], 100] is length 3, even though there is a nested list overall it still only contains 3 elements. Remark 3.1.3 is in the above historical lectures on set theory. We are referred to Appendix A.7 Equality to read about the substitution axiom which you should have already read.
</p>

<p>
Lemma 3.1.6 if set A is equal to set (empty), then if x is in A it must also be in set empty, a contradiction, so A must be a non-empty set is how I interpret the lemma, which is a way to say that if an empty set exists, there must also be a possibility of a non-empty set. Remark 3.1.8 Cardinality if you watched the Wildberger <i>History of Mathematics</i> <a href="#orgd5f114e">lecture</a> linked above assigns a value.
</p>

<p>
Note the errata for Definition 3.1.4 from Tao's site: "Definition 3.1.4 has to be given the status of an axiom (the axiom of extensionality) rather than a definition, changing all references to this definition accordingly.  This requires some changes to the text discussing this definition. Firstly, in the preceding paragraph, “define the notion of equality” will now be “seek to capture the notion of equality”, and “formalize this as a definition” should be “formalize this as an axiom”.  For the paragraph after Example 3.1.5, delete the first two sentences, and remove the word “Thus” from the third sentence. Exercise 3.1.1 is now trivial and can be deleted." So this is now Axiom 3.1.4, but the definition remains the same. 
</p>

<p>
Exercise 3.1.2 prove emptyset, {emptyset}, {{emptyset}}, and {emptyset{emptyset}} are all not equal.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If \(\emptyset\) = {\(\emptyset\)} then by Def 3.1.4 \(\emptyset\) \(\in \emptyset\) a contradiction to Axiom 3.2</li>
<li>Same reasoning as above for \(\emptyset\) is not equal to {{\(\emptyset\)}} or {\(\emptyset\){\(\emptyset\)}}</li>
<li>{\(\emptyset\)} is not equal to {{\(\emptyset\)}} because [list: 1] is not equal to [list: [list: 1]]. The first has element 1 in it, the second has element [list: 1]. More precisely if {\(\emptyset\)} = {{\(\emptyset\)}} then by Def 3.1.4 every element of {\(\emptyset\)} (it's only element is \(\emptyset\)) must be in {{\(\emptyset\)}} (it's only element is {\(\emptyset\)})  and vice-versa, so claiming {\(\emptyset\)} \(\in\) {\(\emptyset\)} which contradicts Axiom 3.3, where y \(\in\) {a} iff y = a. In this case y must = \(\emptyset\) to be in {\(\emptyset\)}.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Remark 3.1.21 clarifies the above exercise how {2} is not in {1,2,3} but 2 is in {1,2,3}. The rest of this chapter is straight forward definitions of set operations, better than the usual treatment of venn diagrams. Remark 3.1.26 distinct is defined as <i>there are elements of one set which are not elements of the other</i> so \(\emptyset\) and \(\emptyset\) are not distinct because neither can have elements. In Proposition 3.1.28 notice how any operation on two sets results in a new set, like a higher order filter function over a list results in a new list. 
</p>

<p>
Example 3.1.32 looks a lot like programming syntax. There seems to be an order of evaluation, applying the axiom of specification first to create a new set, then applying the axiom of replacement so working right to left in {n++ : n \(\in\) {3,5,9); n&lt;6}

<li>3.1.3 prove the remaining claims in 3.1.13:</li>
<li>If a and b are objects, then {a, b} = {a} U {b}:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>By (new axiom) 3.1.4 we need to show every element x in {a, b} is in {a} U {b}. Suppose that x is an element of {a, b} then by axiom 3.3 x = a or x = b. By Axiom 3.4 this means at least one of the following statements is true: x is in {a} or x is in {b}. We divide into cases. If x is in a, then by axiom 3.4 it is in {a} U {b}, similarly if x is in b, it is also in {a} U {b}. Thus in both cases we see every element of {a, b} is in {a} U {b}.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The next claim, prove the union operation is commutative: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Follows the same proof he did for the union operation is associative. Suppose x is an element of A \(\cup\) B. By def 3.1.4 and axiom 3.4 pairwise union then x \(\in\) A or x \(\in\) B. By disjuntion this is also x \(\in\) B or x \(\in\) A. So x is in B \(\cup\) A and x is in A \(\cup\) B.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Last claim, prove A \(\cup\) A is equal to A \(\cup\) \(\emptyset\) is equal to \(\emptyset\) \(\cup\) A is equal to A. Suppose x is an element in A \(\cup\) A, then x is in A or x is in A, so by disjunction (we can pick either, but there's only one choice) x is in A. If x is in \(\emptyset\) \(\cup\) A, x is in \(\emptyset\) or x is in A, so x is in the union of A and \(\emptyset\) and since the emptyset is empty x is in A.</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>3.1.4 prove claims in Proposition 3.1.18 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You can write both these proofs exactly like his 3.1.18 proof for transitivity. Suppose A \(\subset\) B and B \(\subset\) A. To prove that A = B we have to prove that every element A is an element of B, and every element B is an element of A by def 3.1.4. Let us pick an arbitrary element x \(\in\) A. Then, since A \(\subset\) B, x must also be an element of B. But since B \(\subset\) A, then every element of A is an element of B and every element B is an element of A. By 3.1.4 they are equal.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>3.1.15 Show how union, intersection and subset are logically equivalent:</li>
<li>Look in the <a href="#org71517e2">Houston</a> book in the appendix, see the advice for how to prove that two statements are equivalent. For this exercise if A is a subset of B, and the union of A and B = B, then this implies the intersection of A and B will be A, which in turn implies A is a subset of B.

<li>We will show that any two set operations implies another. If x is in A \(\cup\) B, then by definition of union x is in A or B, so by disjunction x is in B. If x is in A, since A is a subset of B then x is again in B. Thus x \(\in\) A \(\cup\) B if and only if x \(\in\) B and by definition of union, and axiom of equality 3.1.4, A \(\cup\) B = B. Since x is in B, if x is in A \(\cap\) B it must also be in A, so x is in A and B, which is the definition of intersection, and if A \(\cap\) B = A, and if A \(\cup\) B = B, then every element of A is in B so A \(\subset\) B.</li>

Our first proof in this chapter is in Lemma 3.3.12, and if we can go by all the previous chapters, this will be our template for the exercises.

A all of these proofs have a youtube tutorial or stackexchange answer, these are common proofs first year students do.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ex 3.3.1 was deleted in errata (See Tao's site)</li>
<li>Ex 3.3.2 The proof for this is in the book <a href="https://infinitedescent.xyz/">https://infinitedescent.xyz/</a>.</li>
<li>Ex 3.3.3 The empty function is always injective since it's 'vacuously true' that f(x) = f(x'). It is never surjective since there are no elements in the emptyset that fit the surjective definition of every element in Y is a value of f(x) of f(x) = y, and thus never bijective, since a function must be both injective and surjective to be bijective.</li>
<li>Ex 3.3.4 The tilde hat thinghy is just notation for two different fuctions, like f and f'. Cancellation law means we're trying to prove two different functions are the same so g = g' and f = f'. If f and g are injective, then g(f(x)) = g(f'(x)) and f(x) = f'(x), and by one-to-one definition of injective functions f = f' (since f is g's input).  Surjective is similar, g(y) = g'f(x)) = g(f(x)) = g'(y) so g = g'. Does g need to be injective for this proof to always hold? Try corner case examples from the text, like if g = n<sup>2</sup>, then g(f(-1)) and g(f'(1)) have the same output, so two different inputs to g with same output means f(x) can't equal f(x') as per definition of one-to-one functions so we can't always derive f = f'.</li>
<li>Ex 3.3.5 If f is injective in g(f(x)), then g doesn't need to be injective. Consider an example A = {1}, B = {2, 3}, and C = {4}. f(1) = g(2) = 4 so f is still injective. The difference in 3.3.4 is the wording 'show that these two input functions are always equal if g in injective' and the second question 'Is this still true if g is not injective?' which means a single case where if g is not injective, and we get two non distinct inputs that equal the same outputg, the whole proof is false whereas here we are asked 'must g always be injective' so just needa single case of not needing to be injective.</li>
<li>Ex 3.3.6 Is described <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2865322">here</a> see Remark 3.3.24 if you forgot what an inverse function is. Note how the inverse of f and f cancel each other out.</li>

Watch <a href="https://youtu.be/K0CoGGcLc1M?t=2161">this</a> starting @ 36:00, from 41:00+ he shows how he solves problems step by step, trying small cases to understand the problem better and poking at the problem enough to finally figure out a proof. You can check your own proofs too, going through Tao's mathematical logic appendix and seeing if the opposite of your argument holds, and double checking all your assumptions 'is there a definition of X or did I just assume it existed'. 
</p>

<p>
So tl;dr relax and just keep writing because the practice of flipping back through the text and rereading definitions and theorems, tracing the logic and seeing how one definition helps define another, and putting this in the form of notes (a proof) is how you learn. This is why none of these books contain solutions because you're supposed to figure it out yourself.

Chapter 3.4 of Tao's <i>Analysis I</i>. Example 3.4.5 makes more sense if you read Example 3.4.6 too, f<sup>-1</sup>({0,1,4}) is the set of everything that could result in {0,1,4} if f(x) = x<sup>2</sup>, so {-2,-1,0,1,2} and in Example 3.4.5, the set of everything in the natural numbers that can result in {1,2,3} if f(x) = 2x, is only f({1}). Axiom 3.11 (Union) if A = {{2,3}, {3,4}, {4,5}} and Ua = {2,3,4,5} why? Because it's {2,3} U {3,4} U {4, 5} you are performing union on every set, this is notation to avoid having to write out an enormous page of union operations.

<p>
The exercises, we've already done similar exercises in set theory there's nothing new here.

The cartesian plane itself is a cartesian product of R x R, you have tuples (x, y) or (x, y, z) so R x R x R. In programming the type int * int is the set Integers x Integers, anything that isn't a cross product of the integers with itself will not type check.

We're doing <i>Analysis I</i> and Linear Algebra in parallel. These sets of lectures cover Linear Algebra from a geometric approach so when we work through Tao's Linear Algebra <a href="https://terrytao.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/linear-algebra-notes.pdf">notes</a> we can understand what is happening.

</ul>

<p>
Welcome to 320 AD in ancient Alexandria you're learning linear algebra with just parallel lines. Around 4000 years ago, the people of Babylon knew how to solve a simple 2x2 system of linear equations with two unknowns and around 200 BC the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nine_Chapters_on_the_Mathematical_Art">book</a> <i>Nine Chapters of the Mathematical Art</i> displayed how to solve a 3x3 system of equations so linear algebra in some form or another has been around a very long time. 
</p>

<p>
He constructs the affine plane from scratch. The vector (8/3, 10,3) you need to full screen to better see exactly where they are. From B, you move right 2 lines, and 2/3 so \(2 + \frac{2}{3}\) which is 8/3. From there you move up 1/3, and 3 so \(3 + \frac{1}{3}\) which is 10/3. Reasons for using the affine plane are you do not impose anything on it artificially like the origin (0,0) in the Cartesian plane, you can do projections easily, and it's construction is simple, since only parallel lines. 
</p>

<p>
The biggest a takeaway here is what vector direction is, what a basis vector is and how you can combine them to form larger vectors, and how to translate basis vectors to suit different perspectives. The exercises at the end the delta symbol will return in the lecture on area and the determinant. 
</p>

<p>
In this optional related <a href="https://youtu.be/Nu-YPJSNFpE">lecture</a> he shows how ancient people made a ruler using just parallel line geometry, which leads to modelling the rational continuum. Some more optional (short) videos is <a href="https://youtu.be/fNk_zzaMoSs">this</a> from 3Blue1Brown on what a vector is, and <a href="https://youtu.be/k7RM-ot2NWY">this</a> presentation of basis vectors and what a span is, but he imposes a cartesian plane, which we've seen isn't needed. Change of basis is video 13 in the 3BlueBrown playlist but the explanation here by Wildberger in the first lecture I find is better.

<p>
The fourth <a href="https://youtu.be/6XghF70fqkY">lecture</a> in the series to lead up to determinants. You probably recognize ad-bc from the first lecture, which was one of the exercises. He uses different notation for bi-vectors since it represents the union of vector a and b. The torque example you have probably seen somebody using a long pipe over a wrench in order to increase the torque without needing increased force, now you know why increasing the area of the wrench increases the torque. All 3 physics examples can be modelled with a parallegram/bi-vector. The bi-vector rules (ie: adding a scalar to one side of a bi-vector doesn't change the bi-vector) will make sense around 35:50 when he produces a picture proof showing how moving things doesn't change the bi-vector. At around 38:00 we once again get the formula ad-bc, the signed area is a scalar of two basis vectors. 45:50 introduces three-dimensional affine space. 
</p>

<p>
Now that you've seen this model of area using bi-vectors, see <a href="https://youtu.be/Ip3X9LOh2dk">this</a> 10 minute presentation by 3Blue1Brown which will fill in some more details, like why the signed area can be negative if you didn't already figure it out. The exercises are conceptually easy, you don't have to do all of them but the whole point of linear algebra is to take these geometric concepts and do them in algebra.

<li>Reminder that the coordinates of a cartesian plane (x, y) are R x R meaning that tuple can have any value in R cross product with itself, so you couldn't have (-1, "string") since string isn't a cross product of R x R.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>At around 54mins we see some new notation denoting all functions from D to F as F<sup>D</sup></li>
<li>He walks through a proof of composition, injective and surjective functions we've already seen in Tao's book</li>
</ul>

<p>
tl;dr We've already done this lecture, it's review with exception to the F<sup>D</sup> notation. There's no homework and the reading is the exact same topics as the lecture so we can skip it, noting there is an intro to probability in there we can read later when it comes up.

<p>
I'm also going to do Tao's linear algebra <a href="https://terrytao.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/linear-algebra-notes.pdf">notes</a> because he has a thorough style we're already used to from his analysis text. There's not many exercises in the notes, the original class <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/resource/general/115a.3.02f/">page</a> has homework and their solutions but you can of course always make the proofs and definitions into your own exercises. Manipulate them and <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/ask-yourself-dumb-questions-and-answer-them/">see what happens</a> when you input edge cases or invert things.

Let's look at week 1. TODO

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org510f1a4">
<p>
Chapter 4 of <i>Analysis I</i> by Tao. Definition 4.1.1 is exactly the definition from the above Wildberger foundations video. Lemma 4.1.3 proof you can finish most of it yourself without reading the whole proof. Lemma 4.1.5 Tao notes the same concerns Wildberger expressed why they both used the 'a less b' style of definition instead of just using Lemma 4.1.5 as the definition of integers, because of the many different cases that would be needed. 
</p>

<p>
Proposition 4.1.6 the proofs of these are all exactly the same as the Wildberger proofs we saw, the rest of the chapter is exercises which teaches us basic algebra with integers.

This definition is similar to 4.2 in <i>Analysis I</i>. The inverse law, write your own example, the rational number 4/1 inverse is 1/4 and 4/1 x 1/4 is 4/4 or 1. Notice how deep into abstraction we are getting. A rational number is (a-b)/(c-d) according to it's definition but we write them as p/q and in some cases just p if q = 1.

The rational number line sits on [0, 1], so you don't end up with a zero denominator which isn't defined. A rational number is a line through the origin [0,0], and an integer lying on point [m,n]. Ford circles are an example of the massive complexity of the rational numbers, which are expanded upon in the next lecture.

<p>
This is about 35m long but worth the watch if you want to see what a convex combination is, learn about rational intervals, and a more complete description of Ford Circles set up with Farey sequences. This will help us understand what a sequence is later in Tao's book. The overall takeaway of this lecture is that the smaller the interval you take on the rational line, the more complex the numbers become with enormous denominators meaning it has a very deep structure.

The next videos, #96 and #97 about Stern-Brocot trees and wedges are highly recommended and can also be found in the book <i>Concrete Mathematics</i>. In Lecture #97, which we can now understand that we know basic linear algebra, he takes a visualization on the plane of the Stern-Brocot tree and shows it also can be used as a geometric interpretation for the rational numbers, it's kind of crazy when you see it. The 'fraction' 1/0 is also explained.

<h2 id="orge0fbbc2">Proof Theory</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge0fbbc2">
<p>
Robert Harper has explained in lectures that CMU students often ask the staff how do they know if their proofs are correct, learning <a href="https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer15/curriculum.html">basic proof theory</a> will help answer that question. In <a href="https://lfcps.org/course/constlog-schedule.html">constructive logic</a> a proof is just an object like any other math object. We will learn natural deduction and how to read/build a proof tree. Finally we're going to learn how to write all our proofs using <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/flaneries/LACI/">Agda</a> a proof assistant, you can enter in the proofs you did for Tao's book and check them yourself.

<li>First these <a href="https://www.hf.uio.no/ifikk/forskning/publikasjoner/tidsskrifter/njpl/vol1no1/meaning.pdf">notes</a> of 3 lectures given by Per Martin-Lof's to understand why we are learning this and where all the terms come from. It's 50 pages but there is a lot of notation eating up space and the margins are huge, maybe 30 pages of text in total. If you can print this out it's comfy casual reading you can do in the evening without frying your eyes with backlight looking at a screen.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We already know what conjunction is from the math workshop</li>
<li>That weird formalism notation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnstile_(symbol)">turnstile</a> and can be read as 'entails', and hilariously the wikipedia article also suggests we read the very paper we are reading to learn about it</li>
<li>line isn't divide or a fraction, these can be called rules and read: if everything above the bar (the premises) is true, then the thing below the bar (the conclusion) is true.</li>
<li>If you haven't figured it out: Gr. (word in greek) or Ger. (word in german) is the notation used</li>
